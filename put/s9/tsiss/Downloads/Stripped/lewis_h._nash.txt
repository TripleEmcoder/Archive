   Lewis H. Nash (1852–1923) was an American engineer who invented the
   [16]liquid-ring-vacuum pump, and was the holder of over a hundred
   United States patents for pumps, engines, and other equipment. He
   founded the [17]Nash Engineering Company in 1905, and served in the
   [18]Connecticut General Assembly.

[[25]edit] Education and early career

   Nash completed his public school education in [26]South Norwalk,
   Connecticut, in 1869. He wanted to continue his education, but his
   parents were unable to pay for college, so he took an apprenticeship
   course as a machinist at the Norwalk Iron Works. Lewis next enrolled at
   a new institution, the [27]Stevens Institute of Technology, which
   offered courses in the new field of [28]Mechanical Engineering. He
   joined its third class, was elected into [29]Tau Beta Pi, and graduated
   as class [30]valedictorian.

   Nash initially found his apprenticeship was of greater value in
   securing work than his degree, so he worked as a machinist in [31]New
   Haven, Connecticut. In the meantime, he continued to work on a design
   he had conceived while in college for a new type of water measuring
   device. He built a model and took it to the National Meter Company of
   [32]Brooklyn, New York. Though the device did not work satisfactorily
   in a test, its merits were appreciated, and he was employed with
   instructions to perfect the meter.

[[33]edit] Water meters

   In a few months, Nash produced the "Crown" meter, the first of a large
   class of single-piston rotary meters, which practically superseded all
   other forms of water meters being manufactured at that time. He
   received over sixty patents for water meters.

   One type of meter, the "Gem", was built in sizes up to 36 inches. The
   quantity of water that could be delivered by such a meter was nearly
   500,000 gallons per hour. This presented a problem in testing, as that
   amount of water could never be taken from the water supply of any city.
   In fact, a single meter of that size would pass enough water to supply
   a large town. Nash was given the task of devising a testing plant which
   re-circulated the water. He accomplished this by the use of a vertical
   screw pump which lifts the water to a reservoir, from which it passes
   through the meter to be tested and thence over a [34]weir, where it is
   measured. The device and the meters both proved to be accurate.

[[35]edit] Gas engines

   After being with the National Meter Company for seven years, Nash began
   the study of the gas engine and subsequently received sixty or more
   patents covering their design and operation. Many of them were
   extensively used by engine manufacturers, including the [36]two cycle
   engine with piston controlled valves. Another patent covered the
   starting of gas engines by the use of compressed air, and this feature
   was adopted by all makes of large gas engines. The National Meter
   Company built the Nash engine in sizes up to about 400 horsepower.
   These engines were used in municipal electric lighting and pumping
   plants as well as for general power purposes. Probably the largest
   installation of the Nash Engine was at the Phoenix Tube Company in
   Brooklyn, and consisted of two Nash Gas Engines, totaling 500
   horsepower, operating on producer gas. The engines were directly
   connected to dynamos and although they operated under violently
   fluctuating load conditions, they ran well, both in regulation and
   economy modes. The Company claimed that the Nash Gas Engine running on
   producer gas, using [37]anthracite buckwheat coal, was the most
   economical of power products, costing twenty cents per 100
   [38]horsepower-hour.

   Nash became chief engineer of the National Meter Company, but his
   relations with them were not the best. The Company never prosecuted
   infringements of their gas engine patents, and Nash's efforts were
   mostly unappreciated, for those at the head of the business not only
   failed to push his developments, but continually curtailed his
   authority.

[[39]edit] Nash Engineering Company

   His relations with the National Meter Company were becoming more
   strained, and when Nash conceived the idea of a new type of air pumping
   equipment, he resolved not to assign the patents to the Company, but to
   manufacture the product himself. This was the beginning of the [40]Nash
   Engineering Company, which initially had its offices on the third floor
   of his residence. In 1905, two of his friends joined him to become
   officers and directors of the new corporation.

   It required three more years of designing and testing before actual
   manufacture was started at a factory over a shop on Water Street in
   South Norwalk. In 1911, Nash and his family moved to South Norwalk, and
   three years later he severed his connections with the National Meter
   Company in order to devote his entire time to the Nash Engineering
   Company.

   The process of rounding out a line of vacuum pumps and compressors and
   of creating a demand for the pumps was slow. In the meantime, a
   micrometer plug gauge, another invention of Nash's, was made. This item
   sold well and generated enough profits to keep the company afloat.

   In 1912, a steady demand had been found for the pumps, and the first
   floor of the present building on Wilson Point Road was erected. The
   building was designed and built entirely from the plans and figures of
   Nash.

   In that year, Nash's eldest son Douglas graduated from Stevens, and it
   was his first task to superintend the construction of this reinforced
   concrete structure. Two years later, Harold, Nash's other son, became
   affiliated with the Company after graduating from Stevens.

   The five years from 1918 to his death on November 17, 1923, Nash saw
   his company grow to be a prosperous, well-established concern, and was
   he able spend most of his time in his laboratory, where he could work
   out his many inventions and ideas.

   During the [41]First World War, he and his son, Harold, were working on
   an aeroplane engine which received favorable comment from the
   [42]National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and engineers such as
   [43]Elmer Sperry, the inventor of the gyroscopic compass and
   stabilizing devices. The war ended before the engine was fully
   developed, and the idea was dropped.

[[44]edit] Awards

   In 1921, Stevens Institute recognized Nash's outstanding achievements
   by awarding him the degree of Doctor of Engineering (E.D.). The
   following year, he was elected Representative to the [45]Connecticut
   General Assembly.
