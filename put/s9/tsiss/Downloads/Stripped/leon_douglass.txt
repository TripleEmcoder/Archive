   Leon Forrest Douglass (March 12, 1869 – September 7, 1940) was an
   American [11]inventor and co-founder of the [12]Victor Talking Machine
   Company who registered approximately fifty patents, mostly for film and
   sound recording techniques.

[[13]edit] Life and professional career

   Douglass was born in rural Nebraska, near present-day [14]Syracuse. His
   parents were Seymour James Douglass, a millwright and carpenter, and
   Mate (Fuller) Douglass. He attended grammar school in Lincoln,
   Nebraska, was apprenticed to a printer, at eleven was working as a
   telegraph messenger, and by seventeen was telephone exchange manager
   for the Nebraska Telephone Company in Seward.^[15][1]

   In 1888 Douglass saw a phonograph for the first time and was
   fascinated. He made his own and took it to Omaha to show it to E.A.
   Benson, President of the Nebraska Phonograph Co., who hired him as the
   company’s agent for the western part of the state. In 1889 he invented
   a nickel-in-the-slot attachment for the phonograph. Benson paid $500
   for the patent and promoted Douglass to a job with the Chicago Central
   Phonograph Company, which he also owned and that was part of the
   [16]Thomas Edison-affiliated [17]North American Phonograph Company,
   distributor for the [18]Edison Phonograph. In the early 1890s Douglass
   invented a machine for duplicating phonograph cylinders and became
   known as "Duplicate Doug." He sold this patent to Edward Easton,
   director of the American Graphophone Company and president of the
   Columbia Phonograph Company, moved to Washington D.C. and worked for
   Easton briefly before returning to the Chicago Central Phonograph
   Company as a manager in 1892. He was elected Vice President and
   Treasurer, and secured a concession for a hundred slot phonographs at
   the [19]World's Columbian Exposition, better known as the Chicago
   [20]World Fair. At the fair he also met [21]Peter Bacigalupi of Lima,
   Peru and San Francisco; he shipped phonographs to Lima for him and
   later traveled to San Francisco where he met his step-sister Victoria
   Adams, whom he married in 1897. After the World’s Fair, Douglass bought
   the hundred slot phonographs and secured a concession for the Midwinter
   Fair in San Francisco; this concession and the phonographs were
   ultimately taken over by Bacigalupi, who then used the machines to open
   a phonograph arcade on Market Street.^[22][1]

   One business opportunity that Douglass was unable to bring to fruition
   was a contract to exhibit [23]Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope at the
   World’s Fair. This would have been the first public exhibition of
   moving pictures, but Edison objected to a clause in the fair contract
   requiring a bond guaranteeing that the exhibit would be ready by the
   opening of the fair.^[24][1]

   In August 1900, after a brief period working in Philadelphia for the
   Berliner Gramophone Co., which was closed by a legal action, Douglass
   agreed to go into business with [25]Eldridge R. Johnson, who owned a
   machine shop in Camden, New Jersey and had supplied machines to
   Berliner. The company started doing business in September 1900 as The
   Consolidated Talking Machine Company but changed to using Johnson’s
   name because of a conflict with a Berliner company name. On October 3,
   1901 it incorporated as the [26]Victor Talking Machine
   Company.^[27][1]^[28][2] Douglass said it was named after his wife, but
   others think it more likely Johnson chose the name to celebrate his
   engineering and legal triumphs.^[29][1] As Vice President and General
   Manager at Victor, Douglass was totally responsible for publicity and
   sales at Victor and therefore is responsible for popularizing the image
   of the dog listening to “His Master’s Voice”. He also developed and
   patented the cabinet and stand that became the [30]Victrola. As he
   wrote in his unpublished autobiography:

          I told Mr. Johnson that it was my opinion that ladies did not
          like mechanical looking things in their parlors Mr. Johnson
          improved on my cabinet and the result was the Victrola, an
          instrument fully enclosed in a cabinet which was an attractive
          piece of furniture. I ordered two hundred. Mr. Johnson was
          afraid we would not be able to sell so many and I was a little
          timid myself, as they cost so much that we would have to sell
          them at two hundred dollars each. We not only sold those but
          many millions more. We were obliged to use seven thousand men to
          make the cabinets alone.^[31][1]

   This made him the inventor of what was by the 1920s the most popular
   home entertainment device in America.^[32][3]

   In fall 1906, a few months after the birth of his son Eldridge,
   Douglass had a nervous breakdown followed by other health problems and
   became unable to work. He moved his family from Philadelphia to San
   Rafael, California. He wrote in his autobiography:

          I urged Mr. Johnson to accept my resignation. He refused and I
          was then elected to the office of the Chairman of the Board of
          Directors. I also urged Mr. Johnson to stop my salary of
          $25,000.00 per year, which they had kept up all during my
          illness, but Mr. Johnson replied that if the Victor Co. paid me
          that amount as long as I lived they could not pay for what I had
          done for them. Twice, in the early days, by my action alone, I
          had saved the Victor Co. from going out of business.^[33][1]

   The other large area of Douglass’ technical innovations was film.
   Inspired by an Ives Komoscope that he bought in 1898, he began
   experimenting with color in 1912, and in 1916 patented the first
   successful process for filming in “natural color” (as opposed to hand
   tinting), the forerunner of Technicolor. He wrote in his autobiography:

          My first moving picture camera made twin negatives, one of red
          value and the other of green. These two negatives were printed
          on a double coated positive, on one side of which the tone image
          was green and on the other side red. When the film was projected
          it gave the natural colors on the screen....The first showing of
          any pictures taken with this camera was on May 15, 1917.^[34][1]

   The April 15, 1918 issue of The Talking Machine World described “Mr.
   Douglas' [sic] device” as “an inexpensive attachment that may be
   affixed to any motion picture camera and which permits of the
   production of a film containing a series of images so colored as to
   give, when projected, a moving picture in natural colors, without the
   use of the rotary colored shutter usually required.”^[35][1]

   In 1918 Douglass produced [36]Cupid Angling, which may be the earliest
   American feature-length color film. It starred [37]Ruth Roland, with
   [38]Mary Pickford and [39]Douglas Fairbanks making guest appearances.
   In March 1921 The Talking Machine World stated:

          Heretofore the best French color motion picture machine could
          not take pictures faster than one second for each section of
          film exposed. Mr. Douglass, after twenty years of
          experimentation and study...has produced a process by which
          color photographs can be taken with an exposure of 1-100 of a
          second. This makes regular motion picture features in color
          possible.^[40][1]

   In 1921 Douglass moved his family to Menlo Park, California, where he
   bought a 52-room mansion that had been built by Theodore Payne, a San
   Francisco hardware manufacturer. Douglass named it Victoria Manor, in
   honor of his wife. He installed a workshop with lathes, milling
   machines, and drill presses in the basement, movie equipment on the
   first floor, and his laboratory workshop on the mezzanine. Since 1945
   the house (now in Atherton) has been owned by the Menlo School and
   College and called Douglass Hall.^[41][1]^[42][3]

   Within a year of the move to Menlo Park, Douglass invented a movie
   camera with a built-in “triple scene dissolve,” which facilitated
   smooth transitions between scenes by making it possible to film
   multiple scenes on one reel and “melt” them together. During his years
   there, he also patented zoom lenses; the first anamorphic lens for
   undistorted wide-angle film photography; and devices for special
   effects such as appearing and disappearing ghosts, shrinking one actor
   in a scene, and the illusion of flames surrounding an actor. By the
   mid-1920s most of the major movie studios had contracts to rent his
   special effects cameras for $5,000 a year each.^[43][1]^[44][3]

   When he sold his holdings in Victor in January 1927, Douglass became
   very wealthy.^[45][1] Then in 1934, he sued four studios, Paramount,
   Fox, Technicolor, and Walt Disney, for $200 million for infringement of
   his “natural color” motion picture patent. He won the suit by default
   when the defendants failed to respond. After lengthy negotiations, a
   financial settlement was reached; the damages agreed upon were not made
   public but believed to be $20 million.^[46][3]

   Douglass also invented underwater cameras. He had a window cut in the
   wall of the pool at Victoria Manor through which he filmed people
   swimming beneath the surface, usually his daughters Ena and Florence.
   In one movie they swim with a seal; in another Florence wrestles an
   octopus (actually a dead octopus with its appendages wired to her
   wrists).^[47][3]^[48][4]

   In 1932, at the invitation of the Smithsonian Institution, Douglass
   participated in a scientific expedition off Easter Island, where he
   filmed at depths up to 1,500 feet using his submarine cameras and also
   an underwater “flashlight” that he also patented. In the mid-1930s he
   participated in a classified US Navy operation filming the ocean floor
   near Pearl Harbor and other strategic sites in Hawaii.^[49][3]

   Douglass also patented inventions in other fields. In 1924 he invented
   a new type of snap cigarette lighter with a trigger-released spring
   actuator. One of Douglass' sons left his position with the Victor
   Talking Machine Company to start the Douglass Lighter Company in San
   Francisco.^[50][1]

   In 1935, two of Douglass’ daughters died, one in a car accident and the
   other in childbirth, and Douglass retired and he and his wife moved out
   of Victoria Manor into a small cottage nearby. He died in San Francisco
   at the age of 71.^[51][1]
