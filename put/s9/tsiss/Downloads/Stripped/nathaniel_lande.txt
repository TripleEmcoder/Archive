   Whose Amazing Adventures are Documented by his True and Trusted Friend
   Rigby Canfield

   His accomplished career spans publishing, television, and films.
   Creative Director for the Magazine Group, [41]TIME

   Director of TIME-Life Films; Executive Producer for both the [43]CBS
   and [44]NBC Television Networks; Producer/Director : Movies of the

   of Programming. Then he joined the producing staff of PM East, hosted
   by [46]Mike Wallace, with his good friend, [47]Peter Lassally, (who
   would later become producer of the Tonight Show at NBC). By night, the
   young and enterprising producers searched for talent discovering
   [48]Woody Allen at the Bon Soir, a small club in New York, and
   [49]Barbra Streisand at One Fifth Avenue, and were the first to book
   them on national television.

   While Creative Director for the Magazine Group at [50]TIME, Inc, he
   innovated presentations for the publishers of the magazines writing
   musical revues. All About Life, One for the Money, and 10 the Musical,
   for LIFE, Money, and People respectively. Each combined editorial
   content and publishing attributes. They were cleaver mini Broadway
   Revues touring the country targeting advertisers. No ad presentations
   had ever been so refreshing and engaging, establishing Nathaniel Lande,
   according to [51]New York Magazine, as a TIME icon. His creators
   included, Scott Ellis and [52]Susan Stroman who later became acclaimed
   Broadway directors. Susan Stroman is best known for Contact and The
   Producers.^[53][6] As Director of [54]TIME World News Service, he

   courage and the horror of America's wars

   Twenty Gold Medals and International Awards, including the New York and
   [56]Cannes Film Festival^[57][8] With [58]Gregory Peck, Nathaniel Lande

   Presidents. Part of his duties included producing [59]White House
   events. His productions of A Salute to Congress and a History of

   starring [60]Walter Cronkite as narrator, delighted the
   Congress.^[61][9]

   Electronic Book and the Bookbank, a computerized electronic storage and
   retrieval system. Toward the Electronic Book, [63]Publishers Weekly
   September, 1991.^[64][10] Another innovation was adapting a motion
   stabilizing system to motion picture cameras, a technology used for
   gunnery sights on helicopters during the war in [65]Viet Nam, he found
   on assignment while making a documentary for [66]LIFE Magazine on
   Helicopter Warfare with the award winning photographer, [67]Larry
   Burrows, who was killed shortly after in [68]Cambodia. The lens won an
   [69]Academy Award for Technology.

   He is author of eight books including two novels. His notable book
   Cricket is partly autobiographical, a coming of age story and triumph
   over a childhood handicap, received critical acclaim from the [70]New
   York Times and [71]Publishers Weekly. Both he, and his central
   character Jonathan Landau, could not speak for the first nine years of
   their lives. Both the real Lande and fictional Landau made significant
   contributions to the first [72]Special Olympics.
