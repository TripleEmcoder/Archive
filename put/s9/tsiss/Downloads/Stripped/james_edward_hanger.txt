   James Edward Hanger (February 25, 1843 – June 9, 1919) was a
   [14]Confederate States Army veteran of the [15]American Civil War, a
   [16]prosthetist and a businessman. It is reported that he became the
   first amputee of the war after being struck in the leg by a
   cannonball.^[17][1] Hanger subsequently designed and created his own
   [18]prosthesis, then went on to found a prosthetic company that
   continues in business today.^[19][2]

[[20]edit] Early life and war service

   Hanger was born at Mount Hope, his father's plantation near
   [21]Churchville, [22]Virginia. His parents were William Alexander
   Hanger and Eliza Hogshed Hanger.^[23][3] He attended local elementary
   schools and, in 1859, enrolled at Washington College in [24]Lexington,
   Virginia, to study engineering. He was an 18-year-old sophomore when he
   decided to leave school and join the newly formed Churchville Cavalry,
   which was under the command of Captain Franklin Sterrett. Two of
   Hanger's brothers and four of his cousins were already enlisted with
   the company, and as he prepared to join them, his mother packed food
   and clothing to send along for her sons. An ambulance corps carrying
   supplies for the [25]Confederacy passed through town, and Hanger joined
   with the group, traveling to [26]Philippi, Virginia (now [27]West
   Virginia). He arrived on June 2, 1861, and after enlisting, spent the
   night in a nearby stable with a small group of untrained and badly
   equipped Confederates. While on guard duty the next morning, Hanger
   heard gunfire, and ran into the stable to get his horse. At that
   moment, a [28]Union cannonball ricocheted inside the stable, striking
   his left leg below the knee. This was the beginning of the [29]Battle
   of Philippi, also known as "The Philippi Races".

   Author Robert J. Driver, Jr., in his book The 14th Virginia Cavalry,
   documents Hanger's firsthand account of this experience:

     The first two shots were canister and directed at the Cavalry Camps,
     the third shot was a 6 pound solid shot aimed at a stable in which
     the Churchville Cavalry Company had slept. This shot struck the
     ground, richochetted (sic), entering the stable and struck me. I
     remained in the stable til they came looking for plunder, about four
     hours after I was wounded. My limb was amputated by Dr. James D.
     Robinson, 16th Ohio Volunteers.

   Hanger's shattered leg was amputated about seven inches below the hip
   bone. This loss of limb is said to have been the first such occurrence
   of a war that saw more than 50,000 additional amputations
   performed.^[30][4]

   Hanger remained in Philippi for several weeks and then was sent to
   [31]Camp Chase in [32]Ohio. In August 1861, he was returned to his
   family home in Virginia in a prisoner of war exchange.

[[33]edit] Recovery and invention

   Dissatisfied with both the fit and the function of his above-knee
   prosthesis, Hanger designed a new prosthesis constructed of whittled
   [34]barrel [35]staves and [36]metal. His design used rubber bumpers
   rather than standard [37]catgut tendons and featured hinges at both the
   knee and foot. Hanger patented his limb in 1871^[38][5] and it has
   received numerous additional patents for improvements and special
   devices which have brought international reputation to the
   product.^[39][1] The [40]Virginia state government commissioned Hanger
   to manufacture the above-knee prosthesis for other wounded soldiers.
   Manufacturing operations for J.E. Hanger, Inc., were established in the
   cities of [41]Staunton and [42]Richmond. The company eventually moved
   to [43]Washington, D.C..

   Other inventions credited to Hanger include a horseless carriage (used
   as a toy by his children); an adjustable reclining chair; a water
   turbine; a [44]Venetian blind; and a [45]lathe used in the
   manufacturing process for prosthetic limbs.^[46][3]

   Hanger married Nora McCarthy in Richmond in 1873. The couple had two
   daughters (Princetta and Alice) and six sons (James Edward, Herbert
   Blair, McCarthy, Hugh Hamilton, Henry Hoover and Albert Sidney). The
   family moved to Washington, D.C., in the 1880s, and their home near
   [47]Logan Circle still stands today. All of Hanger’s sons worked in the
   family business as adults.^[48][4]

   Hanger retired from active management of the company in 1905, however
   he retained the title of president. In 1915, he traveled to Europe to
   observe firsthand the latest techniques of European prosthetists. As a
   result, the company received contracts with both England and France
   during and after [49]World War I. At the time of Hanger’s death in
   1919, the company had branches in [50]Atlanta, [51]St. Louis,
   [52]Philadelphia, [53]Pittsburgh, [54]London and [55]Paris.^[56][4]

   Hanger’s children and grandchildren, along with in-laws, cousins and
   other associates, continued operating and expanding the
   company.^[57][6] By the mid 1950s there were 50 Hanger offices in North
   America and 25 in Europe. In 1989, J. E. Hanger, Inc. of Washington,
   D.C., was purchased by Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. and became part of
   their wholly owned-subsidiary, [58]Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics.
   According to the company's 2007 annual report, net sales for this
   patient care services segment were $571.7 million.^[59][7] As of 2008,
   Hanger Prosthetics & Orthotics sees about 650,000 patients annually.
