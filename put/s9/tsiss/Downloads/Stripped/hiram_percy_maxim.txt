[[25]edit] Early years

   He was the son of Sir [26]Hiram Stevens Maxim, inventor of the
   [27]Maxim Machine gun. In addition, he was the nephew of [28]Hudson
   Maxim, an inventor of explosives and ballistic propellants. He had two
   sisters, Florence Maxim, who married George Albert Cutter, and Adelaide
   Maxim, who married Eldon Joubert, [29]Ignace Paderewski's piano
   tuner.^[30][1] Hiram was a mechanical engineering graduate of the
   [31]Massachusetts Institute of Technology (then a two-year course) at
   age 16.

   Maxim tinkered with internal combustion engines before contacting the
   [32]Pope Manufacturing Company about the possibility of manufacturing a
   gasoline-powered automobile. [33]Albert Augustus Pope hired Maxim to
   run his Motor Vehicle Division. In 1899, with Maxim at the controls,
   the Pope Columbia, a gasoline-powered automobile, won the first
   closed-circuit automobile race in the US at [34]Branford, Connecticut.
   Columbia continued to produce gasoline cars until 1913, and was also a
   major manufacturer of early electric automobiles and trucks.

[[35]edit] Marriage & Family

   He married Josephine Hamilton, the daughter of the former Maryland
   Governor [36]William T. Hamilton December 21, 1898, in Hagerstown,
   Maryland^[37][2], and had a son, Hiram Hamilton Maxim, and a daughter,
   Percy Hamilton Maxim, who married John Glessner Lee, the grandson of
   John J. Glessner. The [38]John J. Glessner House designed by [39]Henry
   Hobson Richardson is now a Chicago landmark. Percy Maxim Lee was
   president of the [40]League of Women Voters from 1950–1958, and
   testified in the U.S. Senate against Senator [41]Joseph McCarthy in
   1955.

[[42]edit] Accomplishments

   Maxim is also noted as the inventor of the "Maxim Silencer", a
   [43]suppressor for firearms (patented in 1909) as well as of a silencer
   (or [44]muffler) for gasoline engines.^[45][3]

   He created the [46]ARRL in 1914 because he saw a need to build up an
   organized group of "relay" stations to pass messages via amateur radio.
   Relaying messages allowed them to pass farther than any single station
   could reach at that time.

   Maxim wrote an amusing account of his youth in the book A Genius in the
   Family: Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim Through a Small Son's Eyes. This book
   was adapted to the screen as [47]So Goes My Love. H.P. Maxim recounted
   his days as an automobile pioneer in his book Horseless Carriage Days
   and also wrote the book Life's Place in the Cosmos, an overview of
   contemporary science that surmised life existed outside of earth.

   His daughter, Percy Maxim Lee (1906–2002) became President of the
   League of Women Voters of the United States and was appointed by
   President Kennedy to the Consumer Advisory Council, which she later
   chaired. She was an advocate for debates by presidential candidates and
   an opponent of abuses by Senator Joseph McCarthy.

[[48]edit] Death

   Hiram Percy Maxim was returning to his home in [49]Hartford,
   Connecticut, in February, 1936, from a trip to California to visit the
   [50]Lick Observatory. He fell ill and was taken from the train to a
   hospital in [51]La Junta, Colorado, where he died the following day,
   February 17, 1936. Hiram P. Maxim was buried in the Rose Hill Cemetery
   in [52]Hagerstown, Maryland, in the Hamilton family plot belonging to
   his wife's family.^[53][3]^[54][4]
