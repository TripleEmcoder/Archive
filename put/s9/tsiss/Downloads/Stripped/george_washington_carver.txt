   George Washington Carver (January 1864^[14][1]^[15][2] – January 5,
   1943), was an American [16]scientist, [17]botanist, [18]educator, and
   [19]inventor. The exact day and year of his birth are unknown; he is
   believed to have been born before slavery was abolished in Missouri in
   January 1864.^[20][1]

   Much of Carver's fame is based on his research into and promotion of
   [21]crops as alternatives to cotton, such as [22]peanuts and [23]sweet
   potatoes. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a
   source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve
   their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins
   for farmers contained 105 food recipes that used peanuts.^[24][3] He
   also created or disseminated^[[25]clarification needed] about 100
   products made from peanuts that were useful for the house and farm,
   including [26]cosmetics, [27]dyes, [28]paints, [29]plastics,
   [30]gasoline, and [31]nitroglycerin.

   In the [32]Reconstruction South, an agricultural [33]monoculture of
   [34]cotton depleted the [35]soil, and in the early 20th century the
   [36]boll weevil destroyed much of the cotton crop. Carver's work on
   peanuts was intended to provide an alternative crop.

   In addition to his work on agricultural extension education for
   purposes of advocacy of [37]sustainable agriculture and appreciation of
   plants and nature, Carver's important accomplishments also included
   improvement of racial relations, [38]mentoring children, [39]poetry,
   [40]painting, and [41]religion. He served as an example of the
   importance of hard work, a positive attitude, and a good education. His
   [42]humility, [43]humanitarianism, good nature, [44]frugality, and
   rejection of [45]economic materialism also have been admired widely.

   One of his most important roles was in undermining, through the fame of
   his achievements and many talents, the widespread [46]stereotype of the
   time that the black race was [47]intellectually inferior to the white
   race. In 1941, [48]Time magazine dubbed him a "Black Leonardo", a
   reference to the Renaissance Italian [49]polymath [50]Leonardo da
   Vinci.^[51][4] To commemorate his life and inventions, George
   Washington Carver Recognition Day is celebrated on January 5, the
   anniversary of Carver's death.

Early years

   Carver was born in Diamond Grove, [69]Newton County, Marion Township,
   near Crystal Place, now known as [70]Diamond, [71]Missouri, possibly in
   1864 or 1865, though the exact date is not known.^[72][5]^[73][6] His
   [74]slave owner, [75]Moses Carver, was a [76]German American immigrant
   who had purchased George's mother, Mary, and father, Giles, from
   William P. McGinnis on October 9, 1855, for seven hundred dollars.
   Carver had 10 sisters and a brother, all of whom died
   prematurely.^[[77]citation needed]

   When George was only a week old, George, a sister, and his mother were
   kidnapped by night raiders from [78]Arkansas.^[79][7] George's brother,
   James, was rushed to safety from the kidnappers.^[80][7] They sold the
   slaves in [81]Kentucky, a common practice.^[[82]citation needed] Moses
   Carver hired John Bentley to find them, but only George was found.
   Moses negotiated with the raiders and swapped a racehorse for the
   infant's return,^[83][7] and rewarded Bentley.

   After slavery was abolished, Moses Carver and his wife, Susan, raised
   George and his older brother, James, as their own children.^[84][7]
   They encouraged George Carver to continue his intellectual pursuits,
   and "Aunt Susan" taught him the basics of reading and writing.

   [85]Black people were not allowed at the school in Diamond Grove. Since
   he had received news that there was a school for black people ten miles
   (16 km) south in [86]Neosho, he resolved to go there at once. To his
   dismay, when he reached the town, the school had been closed for the
   night. As he had nowhere to stay, he slept in a nearby barn. By his own
   account, the next morning he met a kind woman, Mariah Watkins, from
   whom he wished to rent a room. When he identified himself as "Carver's
   George," as he had done his whole life, she replied that from now on
   his name was "George Carver". George liked this lady very much, and her
   words, "You must learn all you can, then go back out into the world and
   give your learning back to the people", made a great impression on him.

   At the age of thirteen, due to his desire to attend the academy there,
   he relocated to the home of another foster family in [87]Fort Scott,
   Kansas. After witnessing the beating to death of a black man at the
   hands of a group of white men, George left Fort Scott. He subsequently
   attended a series of schools before earning his diploma at Minneapolis
   High School in [88]Minneapolis, Kansas.

College

   At work in his laboratory

   Over the next five years, he sent several letters to colleges and was
   finally accepted at [89]Highland College in [90]Highland, Kansas. He
   traveled to the college, but he was rejected when they discovered that
   he was an African American. In August 1886, Carver traveled by wagon
   with J. F. Beeler from Highland to [91]Eden Township in [92]Ness
   County, Kansas.^[93][8] He [94]homesteaded a claim^[95][9] near
   [96]Beeler, where he maintained a small conservatory of plants and
   flowers and a geological collection. With no help from [97]domestic
   animals he plowed 17 acres (69,000 m^2) of the claim, planting rice,
   corn, [98]Indian corn and garden produce, as well as various fruit
   trees, forest trees, and shrubbery. He also did [99]odd jobs in town
   and worked as a [100]ranch hand.^[101][8]

   In early 1888, Carver obtained a $300 loan at the Bank of [102]Ness
   City, stating he wanted to further his education, and by June of that
   year he had left the area.^[103][8]

   In 1890, Carver started studying art and piano at [104]Simpson College
   in [105]Indianola, Iowa.^[106][10] His art teacher, Etta Budd,
   recognized Carver's talent for painting flowers and plants and
   convinced him to study [107]botany at [108]Iowa State Agricultural
   College in [109]Ames.^[110][10] He transferred there in 1891 as the
   first black student and later the first black faculty member. In order
   to avoid confusion with another George Carver in his classes, he began
   to use the name George Washington Carver.^[[111]citation needed]

   At the end of his undergraduate career in 1894, recognizing Carver's
   potential, Joseph Budd and [112]Louis Pammel convinced Carver to stay
   at Iowa State for his [113]master's degree. Carver then performed
   research at the [114]Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment
   Station under Pammel from 1894 to his graduation in 1896. It is his
   work at the experiment station in plant [115]pathology and
   [116]mycology that first gained him national recognition and respect as
   a botanist.

At Tuskegee with Booker T. Washington

   members from [117]Tuskegee Institute in this c. 1902 photograph taken
   by [118]Frances Benjamin Johnston.

   In 1896, Carver was invited to lead the Agriculture Department at the
   five-year-old [119]Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, later
   [120]Tuskegee University, by its founder, [121]Booker T. Washington.
   Carver accepted the position, and remained there for 47 years, teaching
   former slaves farming techniques for self-sufficiency.

   In response to Washington's directive to bring education to farmers,
   Carver designed a mobile school, called a "Jesup wagon" after the New
   York financier [122]Morris Ketchum Jesup, who provided
   funding.^[123][11]

   Carver had numerous problems at Tuskegee before he became famous.
   Carver's perceived arrogance, his higher-than-normal salary and the two
   rooms he received for his personal use were resented by other
   faculty.^[124][12] Single faculty members normally bunked two to a
   room. One of Carver's duties was to administer the Agricultural
   Experiment Station farms. He was expected to produce and sell farm
   products to make a profit. He soon proved to be a poor administrator.
   In 1900, Carver complained that the physical work and the
   letter-writing his agricultural work required were both too much for
   him.^[125][13]

   In 1902, [126]Booker T. Washington invited [127]Frances Benjamin
   Johnston, a nationally famous female photographer, to Tuskegee. Carver
   and Nelson Henry, a Tuskegee graduate, accompanied the attractive white
   woman to the town of Ramer. Several white citizens thought Henry was
   improperly associating with a white woman. Someone fired three pistol
   shots at Henry, and he fled. Mobs prevented him from returning. Carver
   considered himself fortunate to escape alive.^[128][14]

   In 1904, a committee reported that Carver's reports on the poultry yard
   were exaggerated, and Washington criticized Carver about the
   exaggerations. Carver replied to Washington "Now to be branded as a
   liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than I can bear,
   and if your committee feel that I have willfully lied or [was] party to
   such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal."^[129][15]
   In 1910, Carver submitted a letter of resignation in response to a
   reorganization of the agriculture programs.^[130][16] Carver again
   threatened to resign in 1912 over his teaching assignment.^[131][17]
   Carver submitted a letter of resignation in 1913, with the intention of
   heading up an experiment station elsewhere.^[132][18] He also
   threatened to resign in 1913 and 1914 when he did not get a summer
   teaching assignment.^[133][19]^[134][20] In each case, Washington
   smoothed things over. It seemed that Carver's wounded pride prompted
   most of the resignation threats, especially the last two, because he
   did not need the money from summer work.
   Carver circa 1910

   In 1911, Washington wrote a lengthy letter to Carver complaining that
   Carver did not follow orders to plant certain crops at the experiment
   station.^[135][21] He also refused Carver's demands for a new
   laboratory and research supplies for Carver's exclusive use and for
   Carver to teach no classes. He complimented Carver's abilities in
   teaching and original research but bluntly remarked on his poor
   administrative skills, "When it comes to the organization of classes,
   the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or
   section of a school, you are wanting in ability. When it comes to the
   matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite,
   practical, financial results, you are wanting again in ability." Also
   in 1911, Carver complained that his laboratory was still without the
   equipment promised 11 months earlier. At the same time, Carver
   complained of committees criticizing him and that his "nerves will not
   stand" any more committee meetings.^[136][22]

   Despite their clashes, Booker T. Washington praised Carver in the 1911
   book My Larger Education: Being Chapters from My Experience.^[137][23]
   Washington called Carver "one of the most thoroughly scientific men of
   the Negro race with whom I am acquainted." Like most later Carver
   biographies, it also contained exaggerations. It inaccurately claimed
   that as a young boy Carver "proved to be such a weak and sickly little
   creature that no attempt was made to put him to work and he was allowed
   to grow up among chickens and other animals around the servants'
   quarters, getting his living as best he could." Carver wrote elsewhere
   that his adoptive parents, the Carvers, were "very kind" to
   him.^[138][24]

   Booker T. Washington died in 1915. His successor made fewer demands on
   Carver. From 1915 to 1923, Carver's major focus was compiling existing
   uses and proposing new uses for peanuts, sweet potatoes, pecans, and
   other crops.^[139][25] This work and especially his promotion of
   peanuts for the peanut growers association and before Congress
   eventually made him the most famous African-American of his time.

Rise to fame

   Carver had an interest in helping poor Southern farmers who were
   working low-quality soils that had been depleted of nutrients by
   repeated plantings of [140]cotton crops. He and other agricultural
   cognoscenti urged farmers to restore [141]nitrogen to their soils by
   practicing systematic [142]crop rotation, alternating cotton crops with
   plantings of [143]sweet potatoes or [144]legumes (such as [145]peanuts,
   [146]soybeans and [147]cowpeas) that were also sources of protein.
   Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields
   and gave farmers new foods and alternative cash crops. In order to
   train farmers to successfully rotate crops and cultivate the new foods,
   Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that was
   similar to the one at Iowa State. In addition, he founded an
   [148]industrial research laboratory where he and assistants worked to
   popularize use of the new plants by developing hundreds of applications
   for them through original research and also by promoting recipes and
   applications that they collected from others. Carver distributed his
   information as agricultural bulletins. (See [149]Carver bulletins
   below.)
   Peanut specimen collected by Carver

   Much of Carver's fame is related to the hundreds of plant products he
   popularized. After Carver's death, lists were created of the plant
   products Carver compiled or originated. Such lists enumerate about 300
   applications for [150]peanuts and 118 for [151]sweet potatoes, although
   73 of the 118 were dyes. He made similar investigations into uses for
   [152]cowpeas, [153]soybeans, and [154]pecans. Carver did not write down
   formulas for most of his novel plant products so they could not be made
   by others.

   Until 1921, Carver was not widely known for his agricultural research.
   However, he was known in Washington, D.C. President [155]Theodore
   Roosevelt publicly admired his work. [156]James Wilson, a former Iowa
   State University dean and teacher of Carver's, was U.S. secretary of
   agriculture from 1897 to 1913. [157]Henry Cantwell Wallace, U.S.
   secretary of agriculture from 1921 to 1924, was one of Carver's
   teachers at Iowa State. Carver was a friend of Wallace's son,
   [158]Henry A. Wallace, also an Iowa State graduate.^[159][26] The
   younger Wallace served as U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1933 to
   1940 and as [160]Franklin Delano Roosevelt's vice president from 1941
   to 1945.

   Carver was also contacted by the American industrialist, farmer, and
   inventor [161]William Edenborn of [162]Winn Parish, [163]Louisiana, who
   grew peanuts on his demonstration farm.^[164][27]

   In 1916 Carver was made a member of the [165]Royal Society of Arts in
   England, one of only a handful of Americans at that time to receive
   this honor. However, Carver's promotion of peanuts gained him the most
   fame.

   In 1919, Carver wrote to a peanut company about the great potential he
   saw for his new peanut milk. Both he and the peanut industry seemed
   unaware that in 1917 William Melhuish had secured patent #1,243,855 for
   a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeans. Despite reservations
   about his race, the peanut industry invited him as a speaker to their
   1920 convention. He discussed "The Possibilities of the Peanut" and
   exhibited 145 peanut products.

   By 1920, U.S. peanut farmers were being undercut with imported peanuts
   from the [166]Republic of China. White peanut farmers and processors
   came together in 1921 to plead their cause before a Congressional
   committee hearings on a [167]tariff. Having already spoken on the
   subject at the convention of the United Peanut Associations of America,
   Carver was elected to speak in favor of a peanut tariff before the
   [168]Ways and Means Committee of the [169]United States House of
   Representatives. Carver was a novel choice because of U.S. [170]racial
   segregation. On arrival, Carver was mocked by surprised Southern
   congressmen, but he was not deterred and began to explain some of the
   many uses for the peanut. Initially given ten minutes to present, the
   now spellbound committee extended his time again and again. The
   committee rose in applause as he finished his presentation, and the
   [171]Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922 included a tariff on imported
   peanuts. Carver's presentation to Congress made him famous, while his
   intelligence, eloquence, amiability, and courtesy delighted the general
   public.

Life while famous

   During the last two decades of his life, Carver seemed to enjoy his
   celebrity status. He was often to be found on the road promoting
   Tuskegee, peanuts, and racial harmony. Although he only published six
   agricultural bulletins after 1922, he published articles in peanut
   industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, "Professor
   Carver's Advice". Business leaders came to seek his help, and he often
   responded with free advice. Three American presidents—[173]Theodore
   Roosevelt, [174]Calvin Coolidge and [175]Franklin Roosevelt—met with
   him, and the [176]Crown Prince of [177]Sweden studied with him for
   three weeks.

   In 1923, Carver received the [178]Spingarn Medal from the [179]NAACP,
   awarded annually for outstanding achievement. From 1923 to 1933, Carver
   toured white Southern colleges for the [180]Commission on Interracial
   Cooperation.^[181][25]

   Carver was famously criticized in the November 20, 1924, New York Times
   article "Men of Science Never Talk That Way." The Times considered
   Carver's statements that God guided his research inconsistent with a
   scientific approach. The criticism garnered much sympathy for Carver,
   as many Christians viewed it as an attack on religion.

   In 1928, [182]Simpson College bestowed on Carver an [183]honorary
   doctorate. For a 1929 book on Carver, [184]Raleigh H. Merritt contacted
   him. Merritt wrote "At present not a great deal has been done to
   utilize Dr. Carver's discoveries commercially. He says that he is
   merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the
   possibilities of the peanut and other Southern products."^[185][28]
   Yet, in 1932 professor of literature [186]James Saxon Childers wrote
   that Carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for
   the rise in U.S. peanut production after the [187]boll weevil
   devastated the American cotton crop beginning about 1892. Childer's
   1932 article on Carver, "A Boy Who Was Traded for a Horse", in The
   American Magazine, and its 1937 reprint in Reader's Digest, did much to
   establish this Carver myth. Other major magazines and newspapers of the
   time also exaggerated Carver's impact on the peanut industry.^[188][29]

   From 1933 to 1935, Carver was largely occupied with work on peanut oil
   massages for treating infantile paralysis ([189]polio).^[190][25]
   Carver received tremendous media attention and visitations from parents
   and their sick children; however, it was ultimately found that peanut
   oil was not the miracle cure it was made out to be—it was the massages
   which provided the benefits. Carver had been a trainer for the Iowa
   State football team and was skilled as a masseur. From 1935 to 1937,
   Carver participated in the USDA Disease Survey. Carver had specialized
   in plant diseases and mycology for his master's degree.

   In 1937, Carver attended two [191]chemurgy conferences.^[192][25] He
   met [193]Henry Ford at the Dearborn, Michigan, conference, and they
   became close friends. Also in 1937, Carver's health declined. Time
   magazine reported in 1941 that Henry Ford installed an elevator for
   Carver because his doctor told him not to climb the 19 stairs to his
   room.^[194][4] In 1942, the two men denied that they were working
   together on a solution to the wartime rubber shortage. Carver also did
   work with [195]soy, which he and Ford considered as an alternative
   fuel.

   In 1939, Carver received the Roosevelt Medal for Outstanding
   Contribution to Southern Agriculture enscribed "to a scientist humbly
   seeking the guidance of God and a liberator to men of the white race as
   well as the black." In 1940, Carver established the [196]George
   Washington Carver Foundation at the Tuskegee Institute. In 1941,
   [197]The George Washington Carver Museum was dedicated at the Tuskegee
   Institute. In 1942, Henry Ford built a replica of Carver's slave cabin
   at the [198]Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn as a
   tribute to his friend. Also in 1942, Ford dedicated the George
   Washington Carver Laboratory in Dearborn.

Romantic life and Austin Curtis, Jr.

   Little information has survived about Carver’s romantic life, but he
   has come to be an icon of the gay community. Such a fact is testified
   to by his inclusion in the encyclopedia glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay,
   Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture and books such as Out
   in All Directions: The Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America. Carver never
   married or expressed interest in dating women, and rumors circulated
   about his sexuality at Tuskegee Institute while he was an employee. In
   particular, his enjoyment of giving “therapeutic” peanut oil massages
   to and engaging in horseplay with handsome men was seen as unusual.
   Late in his career, Carver established a life and research partnership
   with another male scientist—Austin W. Curtis, Jr.. The two men kept
   details of their lives discreet, and as such historians know little
   about how these men understood their relationship. Nonetheless, the
   fact that Carver willed his assets to this man (consisting of royalties
   from an authorized biography by Rackham Holt) testifies to the
   importance of each other in their lives. After the death of his
   research partner in 1943, Curtis was fired from Tuskegee Institute. He
   left Alabama and resettled in Detroit, where he used the knowledge of
   peanuts he had gained from Carver to manufacture and sell peanut-based
   personal care products.^[199][30]

Death and legacy

   Upon returning home one day, Carver took a bad fall down a flight of
   stairs; he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital.
   Carver died January 5, 1943, at the age of 78 from complications
   ([200]anemia) resulting from this fall. He was buried next to Booker T.
   Washington at Tuskegee University. Due to his frugality, Carver's life
   savings totaled $60,000, all of which he donated in his last years and
   at his death to the Carver Museum and to the George Washington Carver
   Foundation.^[201][31]

   On his grave was written, He could have added fortune to fame, but
   caring for neither, he found happiness and honor in being helpful to
   the world.

   Before and after his death, there was a movement to establish a U.S.
   national monument to Carver. However, because of [202]World War II such
   non-war expenditures were banned by presidential order. Missouri
   senator [203]Harry S. Truman sponsored a bill anyway. In a committee
   hearing on the bill, one supporter argued that "The bill is not simply
   a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the
   war, to do honor to one of the truly great Americans of this country,
   but it is in essence a blow against the Axis, it is in essence a war
   measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the
   energies of roughly 15,000,000 Negro people in this country for full
   support of our war effort."^[204][25] The bill passed in both houses
   without a single vote against.
   1948 US postage stamp

   On July 14, 1943,^[205][32] President [206]Franklin Delano Roosevelt
   dedicated $30,000 for the [207]George Washington Carver National
   Monument west-southwest of Diamond, Missouri—an area where Carver had
   spent time in his childhood. This was the first national monument
   dedicated to an African-American and also the first to a non-President.
   At this 210-acre (0.8 km^2) [208]national monument, there is a
   [209]bust of Carver, a ¾-mile nature trail, a museum, the 1881 Moses
   Carver house, and the Carver cemetery. Due to a variety of delays, the
   national monument was not opened until July 1953.

   In December 1947, a fire broke out in the Carver Museum, and much of
   the collection was damaged from flames, heat, smoke, and water. Time
   Magazine reported that all but three of the 48 Carver paintings at the
   museum were destroyed. His best-known painting, which was displayed at
   the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, depicts a yucca
   and cactus. This canvas survived, but blistering and smoke damage
   marred the surface. It remains on display in the museum, along with
   several of his other paintings, having undergone conservation.
   ^[210][33] Carver appeared on U.S. commemorative stamps in 1948 and
   1998, and he was depicted on a commemorative [211]half dollar coin from
   1951 to 1954. Two ships, the [212]Liberty ship [213]SS George
   Washington Carver and the [214]nuclear submarine [215]USS George
   Washington Carver (SSBN-656) were named in his honor.

   In 1977, Carver was elected to the [216]Hall of Fame for Great
   Americans. In 1990, Carver was inducted into the [217]National
   Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1994, Iowa State University awarded Carver
   [218]Doctor of Humane Letters. In 2000, Carver was a charter inductee
   in the [219]USDA Hall of Heroes as the "Father of Chemurgy".^[220][34]

   In 2002, scholar [221]Molefi Kete Asante listed George Washington
   Carver on his list of [222]100 Greatest African Americans.^[223][35]

   In 2005, Carver's research at the Tuskegee Institute was designated a
   [224]National Historic Chemical Landmark by the [225]American Chemical
   Society.^[226][36] On February 15, 2005, an episode of [227]Modern
   Marvels included scenes from within Iowa State University's Food
   Sciences Building and about Carver's work. In 2005, the [228]Missouri
   Botanical Garden in St. Louis, Missouri, opened a George Washington
   Carver garden in his honor, which includes a lifesize statue of him.

   Many institutions honor George Washington Carver to this day,
   particularly the American public school system. Dozens of elementary
   schools and high schools are named after him. [229]National Basketball
   Association star [230]David Robinson and his wife, Valerie, founded an
   academy named after Carver; it opened on September 17, 2001, in San
   Antonio, Texas.^[231][37]

Reputed inventions

   George Washington Carver reputedly discovered three hundred uses for
   peanuts and hundreds more for soybeans, pecans and sweet potatoes.
   Among the listed items that he suggested to southern farmers to help
   them economically were [232]adhesives, axle grease, [233]bleach,
   [234]buttermilk, [235]chili sauce, fuel briquettes (a [236]biofuel),
   [237]ink, [238]instant coffee, [239]linoleum, [240]mayonnaise,
   [241]meat tenderizer, metal polish, paper, plastic, pavement,
   [242]shaving cream, [243]shoe polish, synthetic rubber, [244]talcum
   powder and wood stain. Three [245]patents (one for cosmetics; patent
   number 1,522,176, and two for paints and stains; patent numbers
   1,541,478 and 1,632,365) were issued to George Washington Carver in the
   years 1925 to 1927; however, they were not commercially successful in
   the end.^[246][38] Aside from these patents and some recipes for food,
   he left no formulae or procedures for making his products.^[247][39] He
   did not keep a laboratory notebook because he didn't want anyone being
   able to steal his work.

   It is a common misconception that Carver's research on products that
   could be made by small farmers for their own use led to commercial
   successes that revolutionized Southern agriculture,^[248][40]^[249][41]
   but these products were intended as adequate replacements for
   commercial products that were outside the budget of the small one-horse
   farmer. Carver's work to apply the scientific method to sustain small
   farmers and to provide them with the resources to be as independent of
   the cash economy as possible foreshadowed the "[250]appropriate
   technology" work of [251]E.F. Schumacher.

Peanut products

   Dennis Keeney, director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable
   Agriculture at Iowa State University, wrote in the Leopold Letter
   newsletter:

     Carver worked on improving soils, growing crops with low inputs, and
     using species that fixed nitrogen (hence, the work on the cowpea and
     the peanut). Carver wrote in The Need of Scientific Agriculture in
     the South: "The virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of
     unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to
     agriculture. This exhaustive system for cultivation, the destruction
     of forest, the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic
     matter, have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains
     than of the North, East or West."^[252][42]

   Carver did market a few of his peanut products. The Carver Penol
   Company sold a mixture of [253]creosote and peanuts as a [254]patent
   medicine for respiratory diseases such as [255]tuberculosis. Other
   ventures were The Carver Products Company and the Carvoline Company.
   Carvoline Antiseptic Hair Dressing was a mix of peanut oil and
   [256]lanolin. Carvoline Rubbing Oil was a peanut oil for massages.
   However, many, if not most, of his inventions seemed to be made just
   for the sake that they could be made and often had little to no real
   world application (or the processes used to turn his beloved peanuts
   into some of his inventions was far too costly to be commercially
   viable or successful). Contrary to popular belief, according to Barry
   Mackintosh, who manages the G.W. Carver National Monument and served as
   bureau historian for the National Park Service, the majority of the
   inventions made during Carver's lifetime in his lab ended up labelled
   either unoriginal and/or impractical and were not, on the whole,
   popular or even moderate commercial successes. But the many, many
   inventions he made from just from peanuts alone caused his reputation
   to precede him as a respected inventor, African-American businessman
   (which was rare, at the time) and the man who could make anything out
   of a peanut.^[257][43]

   He is often credited with the invention of [258]Peanut Butter, a claim
   that has been cited in American schools and educational programs for
   decades. While he may have made peanut butter during his time studying
   the peanut, peanut butter had already existed since the time of the
   [259]Aztecs who made it from a ground and roasted peanut paste. And
   while that version may have been close to what we eat now, it was a one
   Dr. Ambrose Straub of St. Louis (according to the Corn Products
   Company) that patented a peanut butter-making machine in 1903, while
   another doctor of unknown origin is said to have made the first modern
   peanut butter.^[260][44] And while Carver did not invent peanut butter,
   his embracing and promotion of this new invention, as well as Peanuts
   and their other many uses, (mixed with the already rising popularity of
   peanuts and their cultivation at the time) helped bolster peanut
   farming and the peanut as a significant crop in the American South
   starting around the beginning of the
   1900's.^[261][45]^[262][46]^[263][47]

Sweet potato products

   Next to peanuts, Carver is most associated with [264]sweet potato
   products. In his 1922 sweet potato bulletin Carver listed a few dozen
   recipes "many of which I have copied verbatim from Bulletin No. 129, U.
   S. Department of Agriculture".^[265][48]

   The list of Carver's sweet potato inventions compiled from Carver's
   records includes 73 dyes, 17 wood fillers, 14 candies, 5 [266]library
   pastes, 5 breakfast foods, 4 starches, 4 flours, and 3
   molasseses.^[267][49] There are also listings for vinegar and spiced
   vinegar, dry coffee and instant coffee, candy, after-dinner mints,
   orange drops, and lemon drops.

Carver bulletins

   During his more than four decades at Tuskegee, Carver's official
   published work consisted mainly of 44 practical bulletins for
   farmers.^[268][50] His first bulletin in 1898 was on feeding acorns to
   farm animals. His final bulletin in 1943 was about the peanut. He also
   published six bulletins on sweet potatoes, five on cotton, and four on
   cowpeas. Some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa, wild plum,
   tomato, ornamental plants, corn, poultry, dairying, hogs, preserving
   meats in hot weather, and nature study in schools.

   His most popular bulletin, How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of
   Preparing it for Human Consumption, was first published in
   1916^[269][3] and was reprinted many times. It gave a short overview of
   peanut crop production and contained a list of recipes from other
   agricultural bulletins, cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers, such as
   the Peerless Cookbook, Good Housekeeping, and Berry's Fruit Recipes.
   Carver's was far from the first American agricultural bulletin devoted
   to peanuts,^[270][51]^[271][52]^[272][53]^[273][54]^[274][55] but his
   bulletins did seem to be more popular and widespread than previous
   ones.

Religion

   God and science were both areas of interest, not warring ideas in the
   mind of George Washington Carver. He testified on many occasions that
   his faith in [275]Jesus was the only mechanism by which he could
   effectively pursue and perform the art of science.^[276][56] George
   Washington Carver became a Christian when he was ten years old. When he
   was still a young boy, he was not expected to live past his
   twenty-first birthday due to conspicuously failing health. He lived
   well past the age of twenty-one, and his beliefs deepened as a
   result.^[277][24] Throughout his career, he always found friendship and
   safety in the fellowship of other Christians. He relied on them
   especially when enduring harsh criticism from the scientific community
   and newsprint media regarding his research methodology.^[278][57]

   Dr. Carver viewed faith in [279]Jesus as a means of destroying both
   barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification.^[280][58] He
   was as concerned with his students' character development as he was
   with their intellectual development. He even compiled a list of eight
   cardinal virtues for his students to emulate and strive toward:
   A monument to Carver at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis
     * Be clean both inside and out.
     * Neither look up to the rich nor down on the poor.
     * Lose, if need be, without squealing.
     * Win without bragging.
     * Always be considerate of women, children, and older people.
     * Be too brave to lie.
     * Be too generous to cheat.
     * Take your share of the world and let others take theirs.^[281][37]

   Carver also led a Bible class on Sundays while at Tuskegee, beginning
   in 1906, for several students at their request. In this class he would
   regularly tell the stories from the Bible by acting them out.^[282][37]
   Unconventional in respect to both his scientific method and his
   ambition as a teacher, he inspired as much criticism as he did praise.
   Dr. Carver expressed this sentiment in response to this phenomenon:
   "When you do the common things in life in an uncommon way, you will
   command the attention of the world."^[283][59]

   The legacy of George Washington Carver's faith is included in many
   Christian book series for children and adults about great men and women
   of faith and the work they accomplished through their convictions
   respectively. One such series, the Sower series, includes his story
   alongside those of such men as [284]Isaac Newton, [285]Samuel Morse,
   [286]Johannes Kepler, and the [287]Wright brothers. Other Christian
   literary references include "Man's Slave, God's Scientist", by David R.
   Collins, and the Heroes of the Faith series book George Washington
   Carver: Inventor and Naturalist, by Sam Wellman. The conservative
   Christian evangelist Pat Robertson frequently makes references to
   Carver's melding of faith and science in lectures and speeches and
   credits this as an inspiration for founding Regent University.
   The standard [288]author abbreviation Carver is used to indicate this
   individual as the author when [289]citing a [290]botanical
   name.^[291][60]
