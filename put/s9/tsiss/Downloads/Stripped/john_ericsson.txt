   John Ericsson (July 31, 1803 – March 8, 1889) was an American
   Swedish-born [18]inventor and [19]mechanical [20]engineer, as was his
   brother, [21]Nils Ericson. He was born at [22]Långbanshyttan in
   [23]Värmland, [24]Sweden, but primarily came to be active in the
   [25]United States.

[[39]edit] Early career

   John's and Nils's father Olaf Ericsson who worked as the supervisor for
   a [40]mine in Värmland had lost money in speculations and had to move
   his family from Värmland to Forsvik in 1810. There he worked as a
   'director of blastings' during the excavation of the Swedish [41]Göta
   Canal. The extraordinary skills of the two brothers were discovered by
   [42]Baltzar von Platen, the architect of the Göta Canal. The two
   brothers were dubbed cadets of mechanics of the Swedish Royal Navy and
   engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. At the age of fourteen,
   John was already working independently as a [43]surveyor. His assistant
   had to carry a footstool for him to reach the instruments during
   [44]surveying work.

   At the age of seventeen he joined the [45]Swedish army in [46]Jämtland,
   serving in the [47]Jämtland Field Ranger Regiment, as a [48]Second
   Lieutenant, but was soon promoted to [49]Lieutenant. He was sent to
   northern Sweden to do surveying, and in his spare time he constructed a
   [50]heat engine which used the fumes from the fire instead of steam as
   a propellant. His skill and interest in mechanics made him resign from
   the army and move to [51]England in 1826. However, his heat engine was
   not a success, as his prototype was designed to use [52]birch wood as
   fuel, and would not work well with [53]coal, which was the main fuel
   used in England.
   [54]Novelty
   Drawing of a steam locomotive named after [55]William IV

   Notwithstanding the disappointment, he invented several other
   mechanisms instead based on [56]steam, improving the heating process by
   adding fans to increase [57]oxygen supply to the fire bed. In 1829 the
   steam engine he built with [58]John Braithwaite, [59]"Novelty", joined
   the [60]Rainhill Trials, a competition arranged by the [61]Liverpool
   and Manchester Railway. Although it was the fastest in the competition,
   it suffered recurring boiler problems and the competition was won by
   the English engineer [62]George and his son [63]Robert Stephenson with
   [64]Rocket.

   By helping to quell the celebrated Astor House fire, Ericsson's steam
   fire engine proved an outstanding technical success, but met with
   resistance from London's established 'Fire Laddies' and municipal
   authorities. An engine Ericsson constructed for [65]Sir John Franklin's
   use failed under the Antarctic conditions for which, out of Franklin's
   desire to conceal his destination, it had not been designed. At this
   stage of Ercisson's career the most successful and enduring of his
   inventions was the steam condenser, which allowed a steamer to produce
   fresh water for its boilers while at sea. His 'deep sea lead,' a
   pressure-activated fathometer was another minor, but enduring success.

   The commercial failure and development costs of some of the machines
   devised and built by Ericsson during this period put him into debtors'
   prison for an interval and at this time he also married 19-year-old
   Amelia Byam, a marriage that was nothing but a huge disaster and ended
   in the couple's separation until Amelia's death.

[[66]edit] Propeller design

   He then improved the ship design with two screw-[67]propellers moving
   in different directions (as opposed to earlier tests with this
   technology, which used a single screw). However, the [68]Admiralty
   disapproved of the invention, which led to the fortunate contact with
   the encouraging American captain [69]Robert Stockton who had Ericsson
   design a propeller steamer for him and told him to bring his invention
   to the United States of America, as it would supposedly be more
   welcomed in that place. As a result, Ericsson moved to [70]New York in
   1839. Stockton's plan was for Ericsson to oversee the development of a
   new class of [71]frigate with Stockton using his considerable political
   connections to grease the wheels. Finally, after the succession to the
   Presidency by [72]John Tyler, funds were allocated for a new design.
   Unfortunately they only received funding for a 700-ton [73]sloop
   instead of a frigate. The sloop eventually became the [74]USS
   Princeton, named after Stockton's hometown.

   The ship took about three years to complete and was perhaps the most
   advanced warship of its time. In addition to twin screw propellers, it
   was originally designed to mount a 12-inch muzzle loading gun on a
   revolving pedestal. The gun had also been designed by Ericsson and used
   the [75]hoop construction method to pre-tension the [76]breech, adding
   to its strength and safely allowing the use of a larger charge. Other
   innovations on the ship design included a collapsible funnel and an
   improved recoil system.

   The relations between Ericsson and Stockton had grown tense over time
   and, nearing the completion of the ship, Stockton began working to
   force Ericsson out of the project. Stockton carefully avoided letting
   outsiders know that Ericsson was the primary inventor. Stockton
   attempted to claim as much credit for himself as possible, even
   designing a second 12-inch gun to be mounted on the Princeton.
   Unfortunately, not understanding the design of the first gun
   (originally name "The Orator", renamed by Stockton to "The Oregon"),
   the second gun was fatally flawed.

   When the ship was initially launched it was a tremendous success. On
   October 20, 1843 [77]Princeton won a speed competition against the
   paddle-steamer [78]SS Great Western, which had until then been regarded
   as the fastest steamer afloat. Unfortunately, during a firing
   demonstration of Stockton's gun the breech broke, killing the US
   Secretary of State [79]Abel P. Upshur and the Secretary of the Navy
   [80]Thomas Gilmer, as well as six others. Stockton attempted to deflect
   blame onto Ericsson with moderate success despite the fact that
   Ericsson's gun was sound and it was Stockton's gun that had failed.
   Stockton also refused to pay Ericsson and, using his political
   connections, Stockton managed to block the Navy from paying him. These
   actions led to Ericsson's deep resentment toward the US Navy.

[[81]edit] Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater

   When Ericsson arrived from England and settled in New York, he was
   persuaded by Samuel Risley of Greenwich Village to give his work to the
   Phoenix Foundry. There he met [82]Cornelius H. DeLamater and soon a
   mutual attachment developed between the two, and rarely thereafter did
   Ericsson or DeLamater enter upon a business venture without first
   consulting the other."^[83][1] Personally, their friendship never
   faltered, though strained by the pressures of business and Ericsson's
   quick temper, DeLamater called Ericsson "John" and Ericsson called
   DeLamater by his middle nickname "Harry", intimacies almost unknown in
   Ericsson's other relationships.^[84][2] In time, the DeLamater Iron
   Works became known as the Asylum where Capt Ericsson had free rein to
   experiment and attempt new feats. The Iron Witch was next constructed,
   the first iron steamboat.^[85][3] The first hot-air invention of Capt
   Ericsson was first introduced in the ship Ericsson, built entirely by
   DeLamater. The DeLamater Iron Works also launched the first submarine
   boat, first self propelled torpedo, and first torpedo boat.^[86][4]
   When DeLamater died on February 2, 1889, Ericsson could not be
   consoled. Ericsson's death one month later was not surprising to his
   close friends and acquaintances."^[87][5]

[[88]edit] Hot air engine

   Ericsson then proceeded to invent independently the caloric, or [89]hot
   air engine in the 1820s which used hot air, [90]caloric in the
   scientific parlance of the day, instead of steam as a propellant. A
   similar device had been patented in 1816 by the Reverend [91]Robert
   Stirling, whose technical priority of invention provides the usual term
   'Stirling Engine' for the device. Ericsson's engine was not initially
   successful due to the differences in combustion temperatures between
   Swedish wood and British coal. In spite of his setbacks, Ericsson was
   awarded the [92]Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and
   Sciences in 1862 for his invention. In his later years, the caloric
   engine would render Ericsson comfortably wealthy, as its boilerless
   design made it a much safer and more practical means of power for small
   industry than steam engines. Ericsson's incorporation of a
   'regenerator' heat sink for his engine made it tremendously
   fuel-efficient.

[[93]edit] Ship design

   On September 26, 1854 Ericsson presented [94]Napoleon III of France
   with drawings of iron-clad armored [95]battle ships with a
   [96]dome-shaped gun tower, and even though the French emperor praised
   this invention, he did nothing to bring it to practical application.

[[97]edit] USS Monitor

   The Ericsson Mausoleum in [98]Filipstad

   Shortly after the [99]American Civil War broke out in 1861, the
   Confederacy began developing an ironclad based on the hull of the
   [100]USS Merrimack which had been burned by Federal troops before the
   naval base at Norfolk — Gosport Navy Yard — had been captured by the
   recently seceded [101]Commonwealth of Virginia. The [102]United States
   Congress addressed this issue in August 1861 and recommended that
   armored ships be built for the Union Navy. Ericsson still had a dislike
   of the U.S. Navy but he was convinced by [103]Cornelius Scranton
   Bushnell to work on an ironclad for them. Ericsson presented drawings
   of the [104]USS Monitor, a novel design of armored ship, which after
   much controversy was eventually built and finished on March 6, 1862.
   The ship went from plans to launch in approximately 100 days, an
   amazing achievement.

   On [105]March 8, the Southern ironclad [106]CSS Virginia was wreaking
   havoc on the Union Blockading Squadron in Virginia. Then, with the
   appearance of the Monitor, a battle on March 9, 1862 at [107]Hampton
   Roads, [108]Virginia, ended in a stalemate between the two iron
   warships, and saved the Northern fleet from defeat. After this,
   numerous [109]monitors were built, and are believed to have
   considerably influenced the victory of the Northern states. Although
   primitive by modern standards, many basic design elements of the
   Monitor were copied in future warships by other designers.

   Later, Ericsson worked with [110]torpedo inventions, in particular the
   Destroyer, a [111]torpedo boat that could fire a cannon from an
   underwater port. He also provided some technical support for [112]John
   Philip Holland in his early submarine experiments. In the book
   Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition (1877, reprinted 1976) he
   presented his "sun engines", which collected solar heat for a [113]hot
   air engine. One of these designs earned Ericsson additional sums after
   being converted to work as a methane gas engine.

   Although none of his inventions created any large industries, he is
   regarded as one of the most influential mechanical engineers ever.
   After his death in 1889 his remains were brought from the United States
   to [114]Stockholm by [115]USS Baltimore; his final resting place is at
   [116]Filipstad, in [117]Värmland.

     * In the 1936 film [182]Hearts in Bondage, which takes place
       partially aboard the Monitor, John Ericsson was portrayed by actor
       [183]Fritz Leiber, Sr.

     * In [184]Harry Harrison's [185]Stars and Stripes trilogy, the
       Monitor is just the beginning of Ericsson's contributions to the US
       war effort. New ocean-going ironclads are built by the inventor,
       superior to their British counterparts. He also creates an armored
       self-propelled gun platform using his own [186]internal combustion
       engine as well as a heavily-armored mortar carrier ship, capable of
       leveling any fortification in under an hour. All these inventions
       allow [187]General Sherman to implement his new [188]lightning
       warfare strategy.

     * In the US, John Ericsson is considered a hero to Republicans of
       Scandinavian descent. In 1884, a group of Swedish American
       Republicans in Illinois formed the [189]John Ericsson Republican
       League. The League is divided into member chapters throughout
       Illinois. Its activities have earned it the respect of the
       Republican Party throughout the country, and its conventions have
       been attended by two Presidents and innumerable national and
       international civic leaders.
