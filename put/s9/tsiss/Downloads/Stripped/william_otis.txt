   (December 2009)
                      William Smith Otis
      Born     September 20, 1813(1813-09-20)
               [13]Pelham, Massachusetts,  [14]United States
      Died     13 November 1839(1839-11-13) (aged 26)
   Nationality American
    Known for  Inventor of the steam shovel
    Relatives  [15]Elisha Otis (Cousin)

   William Otis (1813–1839) was an American [16]inventor of the [17]steam
   shovel. Otis received a [18]patent for his creation on February 24,
   1839.

   In 1839, William Smith Otis, civil engineer of [19]Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania, was issued a US patent for the [20]steam shovel (No.
   1,089) for excavating and removing earth for railroads or canals. The
   patent drawing showed the crane mounted on a railroad car. A load of
   earth could lifted by the bucket, raised by the crane and turned to be
   dumped, such as in railcars. The patent described how a [21]steam
   engine of a type then in ordinary use, was installed with a power
   control mechanism for the crane, and a system of pulleys to move its
   arms and bucket. It could move about 380 cubic metres of earth a day,
   with its 1.1 cubic metre capacity shovel and 180° slewing wooden jib.
   It was first used on the [22]Western Railroad in [23]Massachusetts.

   William Smith Otis was born on September, 20, 1813, in [24]Pelham,
   Massachusetts, and was cousin to [25]Elisha Otis of [26]elevator fame.
   At an early age, William was interested in earthworks and mechanics. At
   the age of 22, he had shown an uncommon mechanical ingenuity and
   created the first steam powered mechanical excavator.

   Using materials obtained in vicinity of [27]Canton, Massachusetts,
   William created the machine in 1835 which was used building railroad
   lines between Norwich and Worcester. Working with the company
   ,”Carmichael and Fairbanks”, William Smith Otis devised an apparatus
   carrying out the same actions as the person with a shovel.

   Otis moved to Philadelphia and enlisted the talents of Joseph Harrison
   to help construct a prototype. Harrision operated the company ”Garrett
   and Eastwick," and fabricated a pre-production model in 1836. On June
   15, 1836, William Smith Otis received the patent for the invention;
   however during a fire, the engineering specifications had been
   destroyed.

   On February 24, 1839, the patent behind number 1089 officially entered
   validity, and called “the Crane-dredge for excavation and earth
   removals”.

   William Smith Otis died on November, 13, 1839 at the age of 26.
