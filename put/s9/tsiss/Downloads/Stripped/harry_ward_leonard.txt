   Harry Ward Leonard (February 8, 1861 – February 18, 1915) was an
   [16]electrical engineer and [17]inventor whose 30-year career spanned
   the late 19th century and the early 20th century. He is best known for
   his invention, the [18]Ward Leonard motor control system. Equipment
   based on this invention remained in service into the 21st century.

[[25]edit] Early life and heritage

   Harry was born on February 8, 1861 in [26]Cincinnati, Ohio to Ezra
   George Leonard and Henrietta Dana Ward. He was the fourth of their six
   children. He was a great great grandson of [27]American Revolutionary
   War General [28]Artemas Ward. Although his surname was evidently
   “Leonard” and not “Ward-Leonard,” he apparently identified himself as
   either Harry Ward Leonard or H. Ward Leonard. In 1895, Harry was
   married to Carolyn Good in Geneva, Switzerland.

   As a student at the [29]Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
   Harry was instrumental in founding the student newspaper, [30]The Tech,
   and served as the president of the paper’s board of directors. He
   graduated from MIT in 1883.^[31][1]

[[32]edit] Career

   After graduating from MIT, Mr. Leonard was employed by [33]Thomas
   Edison to help introduce the Edison central-station [34]electric power
   distribution system. Within four years, he was promoted to the position
   of general superintendent of the Western Electric Light Company of
   [35]Chicago, Illinois. The following year, he established Leonard and
   Izard, a firm that set up [36]electric railways and [37]generating
   stations. In 1889, his firm was acquired by Edison and Leonard became
   the general manager of the Edison operations in the United States and
   Canada. In 1896, Leonard organized and became president of Ward Leonard
   Electric as an Edison company in [38]Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1898, Mr.
   Leonard left the Edison organization and incorporated his own [39]Ward
   Leonard Electric Company on February 19, 1898 in the village of
   Bronxville in Westchester County, New York.^[40][2]

   While working for Edison, Mr. Leonard patented a number of inventions
   and he continued developing new ideas throughout his career. He was
   granted patents for more than 100 inventions of electrical distribution
   and control systems and related equipment.

[[41]edit] The Ward Leonard motor control system

   The Ward Leonard motor control system was Mr. Leonard’s best known and
   most lasting invention. It was introduced in about 1891 and soon became
   the most widely used type of [42]electric motor [43]speed control.

   In a Ward Leonard system, a [44]prime mover drives a [45]direct current
   (DC) [46]generator at a constant speed. The [47]armature of the DC
   generator is connected directly to the armature of a DC motor. The DC
   motor drives the load equipment at an adjustable speed. The motor speed
   is adjusted by adjusting the output [48]voltage of the generator using
   a [49]rheostat to adjust the excitation [50]current in the [51]field
   winding. The motor field current is usually not adjusted, but the motor
   field is sometimes reduced to increase the speed above the base speed.
   The prime mover is usually an [52]alternating current (AC) motor, but a
   DC motor or an [53]engine might be used instead. To provide the DC
   field excitation power supply, Ward Leonard systems usually include an
   exciter generator that is driven by the prime mover.^[54][3]^[55][4]

   Although only technical specialists are likely to be familiar with Ward
   Leonard systems, many millions of people have ridden in [56]elevators
   powered by Ward Leonard drives. From the 1920’s through the 1980’s most
   electrically driven elevators used Ward Leonard control and many
   systems remained in use at the beginning of the 21st century.^[57][5]

   Many variations of the Ward Leonard system have been implemented, but
   they have generally continued to be called Ward Leonard systems. H.
   Ward Leonard and many others have patented auxiliary [58]control
   systems used to regulate the motor speed as required to automatically
   perform specific tasks such as controlling [59]pump speed to regulate
   flow.

   Mechanical types of [60]adjustable-speed drives and other electrical
   types continued to be used and new types developed after the Ward
   Leonard system was introduced. [61]Electron tube types of DC motor
   controls began to be developed in the 1920’s but electronic controls
   didn’t seriously begin to displace the Ward Leonard system until
   [62]thyristor controlled drives were developed in the late 1960’s. By
   the mid 1970’s, Ward Leonard drives were rapidly becoming obsolete, but
   the replacement of existing Ward Leonard drives has continued past the
   end of the 20th century.

[[63]edit] Sudden death

   H. Ward Leonard was an active member of the [64]American Institute of
   Electrical Engineers, publishing technical papers, attending meetings
   and making presentations. He died suddenly on February 18, 1915 in New
   York while attending the annual dinner of the American Institute of
   Electrical Engineers.^[65][6]
