   Emile Berliner (May 20, 1851 – August 3, 1929) was a [20]German
   naturalized [21]American [22]inventor. He is best known for developing
   the [23]disc record [24]gramophone ([25]phonograph in [26]American
   English). He founded The [27]Berliner Gramophone Company in 1895, The
   [28]Gramophone Company in [29]London, England, in 1897, [30]Deutsche
   Grammophon in [31]Hanover, [32]Germany, in 1898 and [33]Berliner
   Gram-o-phone Company of Canada in [34]Montreal in 1899 (chartered in
   1904).

[[42]edit] Life and work

   Born in [43]Hanover, [44]Germany in 1851, Berliner migrated to the
   [45]United States of America in 1870, where he lived in [46]Washington,
   D.C. After some time working in a livery stable, he became interested
   in the new [47]audio technology of the [48]telephone and
   [49]phonograph, and invented an improved telephone transmitter (one of
   the first type of [50]microphones). The patent was acquired by the
   [51]Bell Telephone Company, see [52]The Telephone Cases. But on
   February 27, 1901 the [53]United States Court of Appeal declared the
   patent void. Berliner subsequently moved to [54]Boston in 1877 and
   worked for Bell Telephone until 1883, when he returned to Washington
   and established himself as a private researcher.

   Emile Berliner became a United States citizen in 1881.
   Record made in 1908 in Hanover, Germany by Emile Berliner's Gramophone
   Company (later [55]Deutsche Grammophon)

   In 1886 Berliner began experimenting with methods of [56]sound
   recording. He was granted his first [57]patent for what he called the
   [58]"gramophone" in 1887. The first gramophones recorded sound using
   horizontal [59]modulation on a [60]cylinder coated with a low
   resistance material such as [61]lamp black, subsequently fixed with
   [62]varnish and then copied by [63]photoengraving on a metal playback
   cylinder. This was similar to the method employed by [64]Edison's
   machines. In 1888 Berliner invented a simpler way to record sound by
   using [65]discs. Within a few years he was successfully marketing his
   technology to [66]toy companies. However, he hoped to develop his
   device as more than a mere toy, and in 1895 persuaded a group of
   businessmen to put up $25,000 with which he created the [67]Berliner
   Gramophone Company.

   A problem with early gramophones was getting the turntable to rotate at
   a steady speed during playback of a disc. Engineer [68]Eldridge R.
   Johnson helped solve this problem by designing a clock-work
   spring-wound motor. In 1901 Berliner and Johnson teamed up to found the
   [69]Victor Talking Machine Company.

   Berliner's other inventions include a new type of [70]loom for
   mass-production of cloth; an acoustic tile; and an early version of the
   [71]helicopter. According to a July 1, 1909, report in [72]The New York
   Times, a helicopter built by Berliner and J. Newton Williams of
   [73]Derby, Connecticut, had lifted its operator (Williams) "from the
   ground on three occasions" at Berliner's laboratory in the
   [74]Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

   In fact between 1907 and 1926, Berliner dedicated himself to improving
   the technologies of vertical flight through the development of a
   light-weight rotary engine, which he improved upon throughout the 1910s
   and 1920s. With R.S. Moore, also a Scientist and Inventor, as his chief
   assistant, Berliner obtained automobile engines from the Adams-Farwell
   Company, an automobile manufactor of Dubuque, Iowa, which he promptly
   rebuilt as revolving engines for use in perfecting “machines” produced
   for vertical flight. His realizations allowed him to move away from the
   heavy in-line engines to lighter rotary models, which led to the
   invention of a 6-hp rotary engine for the improvement of vertical
   flight. It was these experiments that led to the formal creation of the
   Gyro Motor Company in 1909 after inventing the engine between 1907-08.
   And it was the creation the 6-hp rotary engine that initiated the use
   of rotary engines in aviation. The Gyro Motor Company manufactored
   these and other improved versions of the Gyro Engine between 1909 and
   roughly 1926. The building used for these operations exists at 774
   Girard Street, NW, Washingon DC, where its principal facade is in the
   Fairmont-Girard alleyway.^[75][1]

   By 1910, continuing to advance vertical flight, Berliner experimented
   with the use of a vertically mounted tail rotor to counteract torque on
   his single main rotor design. And it was this configuration that led to
   the mechanical development of practical helicopters of the 1940s. When
   the Gyro Motor Company opened, [76]Spencer Heath (1876-1863), a
   mechanical engineer (among other things), became the manager. Heath was
   connected with the American Propeller Company, also a manufacturer of
   aeronautical related mechanisms and products in Baltimore, Maryland.
   Both R.S. Moore, Designer and Engineer, and Joseph Sanders (1877-1944),
   inventor, engineer, and manufacturer, were involved in the original
   operations of the company. Berliner was president of the newly founded
   Gyro Motor Company and much of his time was spent dealing with business
   operations.^[77][2] which merged to become [78]Berliner-Joyce Aircraft

   On July 16, 1922, Berliner and his son, [79]Henry, demonstrated a
   working helicopter for the [80]United States Army. Henry became
   disillusioned with helicopters in 1925, and in 1926 founded the
   Berliner Aircraft Company,^[81][2] which merged to become
   [82]Berliner-Joyce Aircraft in 1929.

   Berliner, who suffered a nervous breakdown in 1914,^[83][3] was also
   active in advocating improvements in public health and [84]sanitation.

   Berliner was awarded the [85]Franklin Institute's [86]John Scott Medal
   in 1897, and later the [87]Elliott Cresson Medal in 1913 and the
   [88]Franklin Medal in 1929.

   Emile Berliner died of a [89]heart attack at the age of 78 and is
   buried in [90]Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., alongside his
   wife and a son.
