[[22]edit] Early life and education

   Altman grew up in [23]Rogers Park, Chicago, Illinois. After
   kindergarten his family moved to Highland Park, Illinois. Altman
   graduated from [24]Deerfield High School (Illinois) in 1975. Altman is
   an alumnus of the [25]University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where
   he earned an undergraduate degree(1980) and a master's degree(1984) in
   electrical engineering. While at the University of Illinois, Altman
   co-founded Hash Wednesday. Other sources claim Hash Wednesday was
   celebrated as early as 1973 making Altman's claim suspect. Altman moved
   to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1986 to work in [26]Silicon Valley.

[[27]edit] Virtual Reality

   Altman is widely regarded as a pioneer of Virtual Reality. He worked at
   VPL Research with [28]Jaron Lanier. Altman left VPL Research when it
   started getting military contracts.

[[29]edit] 3ware

   Altman co-founded Silicon Valley start-up 3ware in February 1997 with
   J. Peter Herz and Jim MacDonald (who is on the advisory board of
   Cornfield Electronics).

[[30]edit] Cornfield Electronics

   Altman started Cornfield Electronics as a consultancy company. After
   the launch of TV-B-Gone Altman gave the company the tagline "Useful
   Electronics for a Better World".

[[31]edit] TV-B-Gone

   In 2004 Altman released a one-button universal remote control called
   TV-B-Gone, to be used for turning off TVs in public places. According
   to Altman, "TV has become a worldwide epidemic and sadly, a way of life
   for some people". In an interview with the BBC, he stated "I don't want
   to make anyone's life more difficult. I just don't like TV, and I'd
   like people to think more about this powerful medium in their lives."
   Altman used money from the sale of 3ware to pay for the manufacture of
   the first 20,000 units of TV-B-Gone.

[[32]edit] Other activities

   A workshop at HackerspaceSG in Singapore

   In 2007, Altman and [33]Jacob Appelbaum began discussing the idea of a
   [34]hackerspace in San Francisco, which at the time lacked one. In
   October 2008 they and several others founded [35]Noisebridge. Altman
   also travels extensively, teaching electronics workshops and visiting
   computer and electronics enthusiast groups around the world.
