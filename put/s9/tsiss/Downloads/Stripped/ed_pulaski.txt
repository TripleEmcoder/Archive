   Edward C. "Ed" Pulaski (1868–1931) was a [9]U.S. Forest Service ranger
   based in [10]Wallace, Idaho. Pulaski traveled west and worked as a
   miner, railroad worker, and [11]ranch foreman before joining the forest
   service in 1908.^[12][1]

[[17]edit] Great Fire of 1910

   On August 20, 1910, Pulaski was credited with saving all but five of
   his 45-man crew during what is known as the "Great Idaho Fire" or the
   "[18]Big Blowup". It had been unusually dry in 1910 and [19]forest
   fires were rampant across the northern [20]Rockies. Pulaski was
   supervising crews on the west fork of Placer Creek, about five miles
   south of Wallace, when the fire suddenly broke out of control,
   overwhelming the crew.

   Drawing on his knowledge of the area and of the dynamics of forest
   fires, Pulaski led his men to safety in an abandoned prospect mine.
   After ordering his crew into an abandoned mine tunnel, he threatened to
   shoot with his pistol any man who left. Lying prone on the tunnel
   floor, all but five of the firefighters survived, but two horses with
   them died from smoke inhalation.^[21][2] The mine entrance, now known
   as the Pulaski Tunnel, is listed on the [22]National Register of
   Historic Places.^[23][3]

[[24]edit] Pulaski firefighting tool

   Pulaski is widely credited for the invention of the [25]Pulaski in
   1911, a hand tool commonly used in [26]wildland firefighting. A
   combination hand tool with a [27]mattock for digging or grubbing on one
   side and an [28]axe for chopping on the other, it is often called a
   "Pulaski tool".^[29][4]

   Mount Pulaski, a 5480 foot (1670 m) peak 1.5 miles southwest of
   Wallace, is named for him.

   The US Forest Service's Pulaski Tunnel Trail near Wallace, ID, provides
   access to the Nicholson Mine site where Pulaski and his team took
   shelter.
