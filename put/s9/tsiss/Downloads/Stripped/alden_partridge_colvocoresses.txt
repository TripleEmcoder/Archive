Alden Partridge Colvocoresses

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: [5]navigation, [6]search

   Colonel Alden Partridge Colvocoresses (1918-March 27, 2007), USA
   (Ret.), developed in 1973 - 1979 the [7]Space-oblique Mercator
   projection with [8]John Parr Snyder and John L. Junkins. Colvocoresses
   was the first to realize that such a projection was needed and
   mathematically feasible, and in 1974 defined it geometrically as a
   projection that maps images from [9]Landsat [10]satellites, which he
   used to develop the first [11]satellite map of the [12]United
   States.^[13][1]

[[18]edit] Biography

   Alden P. Colvocoresses was born the son of George M. Colvocoresses II
   and Alice Hagen in [19]Humbolt, [20]Arizona, in 1918. He is the
   grandson of [21]George Partridge Colvocoresses and the great-grandson
   of [22]George Colvocoresses. He served in the [23]United States Army in
   [24]World War II, in the 16th Armored Engineer Battalion of the [25]1st
   Armored Division, pulling duties in [26]North Africa and [27]Europe. He
   was twice wounded in combat and has received the [28]Purple Heart as
   well as two [29]Silver Stars with [30]Oak Leaf Clusters, the second
   awarded under the command of Major General [31]Ernest N. Harmon, who
   later served as president of [32]Norwich University for 15 years, from
   1950-1965. Alden became involved with aerial photo mapping for the 1st
   Army, where he oversaw some of the photo mapping as preparation for the
   [33]D-Day assault on [34]Normandy.

   After leaving the Army, Alden was a pioneer in satellite mapping
   techniques, including the Space-oblique Mercator projection that maps
   images from [35]Landsat [36]satellites, which he used to develop the
   first satellite map of the [37]United States.

   On May 8, 2005 Colvocoresses gave his great-great-niece, [38]Gretchen
   Herrboldt Hahn, graduate of [39]NU 2005, the commissioning oath as a
   2nd [40]Lieutenant in the [41]U.S. Army. She became the first
   descendant of [42]Norwich University founder [43]Alden Partridge to
   graduate from Norwich in 138 years. Alden is the brother of Gretchen's
   maternal great-great grandmother and a key link in a military family
   whose roots are entwined deep in the Norwich tradition.

   He died March 27, 2007 at Inova Fairfax Hospital. He is buried at
   [44]Arlington National Cemetery.
