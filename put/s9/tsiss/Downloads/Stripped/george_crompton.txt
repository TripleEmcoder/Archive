   George Crompton (23 March 1829 – 29 December 1886) was an American
   inventor, manufacturer, and businessman and the son of [16]William
   Crompton, an inventor. He is most well known for his invention,
   perfection, and popularization of the [17]Crompton Loom, a fancy loom
   that could reach maximum speeds of eighty-five picks per second, nearly
   twice the speed of its most efficient predecessors. Crompton Loom
   Works, located in his hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts, aided in
   the Civil War effort to provide uniforms and blankets for the U.S.
   Army. Crompton’s looms did have competition from foreign innovations,
   yet when brought to the Paris [18]Exposition Universelle (1867) his
   products won a silver medal. His looms were also present at the
   Philadelphia [19]Centennial Exposition of 1876. From these two events,
   the Crompton Loom gained popularity and became famous throughout the
   manufacturing circle. Crompton was also quite involved in his town of
   Worcester; he was a member of the common council (1860–1861) and held
   the office of [20]alderman (1863–1864), in addition to running for
   mayor unsuccessfully in 1871. When he died, the community of
   [21]Worcester, Massachusetts announced that it had lost the man who
   helped the town transform from a “pretty New England town” to an
   industrial city. Crompton was inducted into the [22]National Inventors
   Hall of Fame in 2007 due to the large-scale impact of his loom.

[[36]edit] Early life

   George Crompton was born at Holcombe, Tottington, [37]Lancashire,
   England on March 23, 1829 to William Crompton and Sarah Low. The
   Crompton family immigrated to the United States in 1836 when George was
   nine and lived in [38]Taunton, Massachusetts. Even early in his life,
   multiple sources cite Crompton’s uncanny mechanical ability and
   problem-solving prowess.

   In 1837, George’s father William, who worked in the textile industry,
   invented the first fancy power loom. Since looms were certainly a part
   of George Crompton’s childhood, his father’s invention most likely
   began to lay the foundation for George’s soon-to-be successful career.

[[39]edit] Education

   Crompton attended elementary school in [40]Belmont, England before his
   family moved to America. After the immigration, he attended public
   schools in Taunton, Massachusetts and Worcester, Massachusetts. For
   secondary school he attended [41]Millbury Academy in Worcester, the
   equivalent of a modern-day high school, and graduated in the normal
   time period. He did not attend college; rather, he gained
   occupation-specific experience as a part of the workforce. No mention
   is made of Crompton’s level of achievement in school, subjects he was
   interested in, or personal opinions of his academic experience.

[[42]edit] Early career

   After graduating from Millbury Academy, George Crompton held two
   separate positions, one in his father’s office as a bookkeeper, and one
   as a mechanic for the [43]Colt Company. Crompton saw the innovative
   skill of [44]Samuel Colt, a manufacturer and owner of the Colt Company,
   on a daily basis. This insight into an inventor’s mind most likely
   provided another basis for George Crompton’s eventual knack for
   invention and keen business sense, in addition to his interest in the
   manufacturing industry.

   Crompton’s first venture took place in 1849, when the patent for his
   father’s loom was about to expire. William Crompton suddenly became
   incapacitated, so his son took over the family business. This meant
   that George had to renew the fancy power loom’s patent in Washington,
   D.C. At that time, patents were granted for fourteen years, and he
   believed that instability in the tariff rates had prevented the
   invention from achieving its highest profits during the patent’s first
   term. Therefore George called upon Edson Fessenden, conservator of
   William Crompton’s estate, who gave George money to travel to
   Washington, D.C. to argue with the patent office. Despite George’s
   young age and lack of experience, the patent office listened to his
   arguments and renewed the patent.

   A few years after taking over the business, in 1851, Crompton joined
   Merrill E. Furbush, and together they manufactured looms in a factory
   in Worcester, concentrating on “narrow looms” until 1857. However, in
   1854, a fire burned down the entire factory, and the two men were
   advised to declare bankruptcy due to debt. They refused to do so,
   however, and instead asked every single creditor for an extension and
   drove through the countryside to collect money to pay back the debt.
   After successfully warding off creditors, the two moved their business
   to Grove Street in Worcester.

   It was after the move in 1857 that Crompton began to produce his most
   important invention, the Crompton Loom.

[[45]edit] Invention of the Crompton Loom

   In 1857, after spending six years on “[46]narrow looms”, Crompton built
   and implemented a fast-operating [47]broad fancy loom in an attempt to
   improve upon his father’s invention. This new loom had twenty-four
   harnesses and three boxes at each end, and it could reach speeds of up
   to eighty-five picks per minute, a pace that almost doubled what even
   the most efficient loom could reach prior to Crompton’s invention
   (forty-five picks per minute). As stated in an 1882 [48]Los Angeles
   Times article, the Crompton Loom allowed mills to produce “[cashmeres],
   fine flannels, fancy blankets, buggy robes, etc., and fancy colored
   stocking yarns”. His improvements on his father's loom reduced the
   labor required to run looms by one half,^[49][1] and made looms easier
   to maintain and repair while also making them easier and less expensive
   to build. In all, the Crompton Loom allowed workers to create sixty
   percent more on a loom that was less expensive and easier to sustain,
   thus making the process much more efficient.

   The Crompton Loom evolved from multiple acquisitions of patents
   throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Furbush and Crompton held multiple
   other patents that improved the “narrow looms”, such as double reverse
   motion improvements. James Greenhalgh patented the first open-shed loom
   in 1852, but in 1857 the patent was found to be too close to William
   Crompton’s power fancy loom, and therefore the Greenhalgh Loom patent
   was disallowed. William Crompton’s patent expired the next year, and
   when it did, Crompton and Furbush purchased the rights to the
   Greenhalgh Loom, improved it in several ways, and called it the
   Crompton Loom. This 1857 version of the loom would improve again,
   however, until it became one of the best in the world at the Paris
   Exhibition in 1867, and later would become the standard fancy cotton
   loom of the United States (around 1870).

   Two years after inventing his loom, Crompton broke his partnership with
   Furbush and formed [50]Crompton Loom Works, which produced and marketed
   his loom. Since the invention benefited mills so much by making a
   tedious and expensive process easier with little cost, the Crompton
   Loom sold quite quickly and easily. This is proven by the fact that
   Crompton Loom Works produced and sold extraordinary amounts of Crompton
   looms during the Civil War, a time in which uniforms and blankets were
   needed in abundance. Since the [51]American Civil War started in the
   early 1860s and the Crompton Loom was invented in 1857, one can say
   that the loom became an integral part of the textile industry quite
   soon after its invention.

[[52]edit] Corporate/Political Ventures

   Due to the prolific nature of his product, Crompton received many
   offers from foreign firms to buy the rights to his product and act as a
   European distributor. A German firm run by the [53]Schoenherr Brothers
   bought the rights to the Crompton loom and, contrary to the agreement,
   immediately cut off all contact with Crompton Loom Works. While the
   Brothers were supposed to pay fifty dollars in royalties per loom sold,
   Crompton never received any money. After numerous letters over a
   ten-year period, he traveled to Germany with a German lawyer to force
   the Schoenherr Brothers to pay. German courts were troubled by the fact
   that Crompton could not prove how many looms were manufactured in
   Germany, and when he tried to peer into the windows of the Schoenherr
   factory to count, German authorities arrested him on the grounds of
   breaking patent law. Crompton was quickly released and eventually won
   the case, yet he received almost no damage payment. Lawyers told him
   that the German courts would never side with a non-German. Because
   Crompton could not stop the Schoenherr Brothers, nothing prevented them
   from spreading his loom all throughout Europe, making it a standard and
   easily recreated technology.

   Since he still made so much money in the domestic markets with the
   Crompton Loom Works, George Crompton had both the interest and the
   ability to invest in other Worcester corporations. He was founder and
   president of the [54]Crompton Carpet Company, and paid over $200,000
   upon the company’s failure in 1878. He was also on the board of
   directors of the [55]Worcester Gas Light Company, the [56]Worcester
   National Bank, and the [57]Hartford Steam Boiler Insurance Company.
   These corporate ventures proved that, along with his innovative skill,
   Crompton could be a successful businessman.

   Like many wealthy men of his time, Crompton was involved in politics.
   He was alderman in Worcester from 1863–1864, and was a member of the
   common council of Worcester in 1860-1861. Crompton ran for mayor of
   Worcester in 1871 as the Republican candidate, and his loss was one of
   the greatest hindrances to his personal and political goals. He still
   remained active in the town, however, and presented a speech at the
   dedication of the Soldiers’ Monument in 1874.

[[58]edit] Personal life

   After much success selling his loom in the late 1850s and early 1860s,
   Crompton bought a dozen acres of land in Worcester surrounding and
   including an Elizabethan-style mansion called “[59]Mariemont”, along
   with various other pieces of land throughout Worcester. He started a
   family, marrying Mary Christina Pratt in 1853, and had nine children
   who grew up in Mariemont. Although Crompton was technical and
   intellectual, he was also quite sociable. Mariemont always had guests,
   either friends of the nine children or friends of George and Mary.
   Besides being sociable, Crompton was also very learned. He enjoyed
   reading the many books he had in his libraries, and was said by some to
   be more learned than most men who had received a college education. He
   had a defined taste in art, loved to tell stories, and had a tendency
   to be adventurous. After living at Mariemont for nearly a quarter of a
   century, Crompton died at home on December 29, 1886.

[[60]edit] Awards and recognition

   Crompton was recognized multiple times for his achievements in the
   textile industry. In 1867, he brought his looms to the Paris
   Exhibition, where he competed against similar technologies from
   Belgian, Saxon, English, Prussian, and French looms. According to a
   transoceanic telegram following the awards ceremony, Crompton’s looms
   won a silver medal, a great recognition at such a prestigious event. In
   addition, Crompton’s looms were present at the Centennial Exhibition in
   Philadelphia in 1876 where he received an award “for the best looms for
   fancy weaving on shawls, cassimeres, and satinets.”^[61][1] In 1920,
   the [62]Worcester County Trust Company wrote a book called "[63]Forty
   Immortals of Worcester and Its Country", in which Crompton appeared.
   For Worcester’s centennial celebration, the town included Crompton in a
   list of twenty-four men who the town felt represented Worcester.
   Crompton was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007
   because, according to the website, “Over his lifetime, George
   Crompton's inventive prowess revolutionized the textile industry.”

[[64]edit] Legacy

   Besides producing over one hundred patents surrounding the improvement
   of his loom, Crompton left behind a legacy that members of the
   Worcester community easily recognized. He continued his father’s trend
   and successfully brought textile weaving to America from Britain. While
   Crompton lived in Worcester for the majority of his life, his impact
   could be felt throughout many New England towns; he brought areas
   formerly considered “pretty New England” towns into the forefront of
   the American Industrial Revolution. While Crompton’s humility kept him
   from becoming one of the most celebrated and written about inventors,
   his Crompton Loom was widely used in the United States for many years,
   and Crompton Loom Works, which became [65]Crompton & Knowles in 1897,
   lasted well into the twentieth century. In fact, Crompton & Knowles
   existed until 1999, when it merged with [66]Witco Corporation to form
   [67]Crompton Corporation. In 2005, Crompton Corporation merged with
   [68]Great Lakes Chemical Corporation to form [69]Chemtura Corporation,
   the current manifestation of the original Crompton Loom Works.
