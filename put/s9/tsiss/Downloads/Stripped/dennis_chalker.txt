[[21]edit] Career

   Chalker began his military service with the [22]U.S. Army, serving in
   the [23]82nd Airborne Division. Upon discharge he tried his hand at a
   few civilian jobs and found them less than challenging, Chalker then
   joined the [24]United States Navy to become a [25]Navy SEAL where he
   eventually rose to the rank of [26]Command Master Chief of [27]Naval
   Special Warfare Center(NWSC BUD/S) and retired as an E-9.^[28][1]

   Chalker initially served with SEAL Team One and was hand-selected by
   Commander [29]Richard Marcinko to become a [30]Plankowner member of the
   Navy's first dedicated counter-terrorist unit, [31]SEAL Team Six. As a
   member of SEAL Team Six, he participated in a mission during
   [32]Operation Urgent Fury in the US Invasion of [33]Grenada. His team
   reached then Governor General [34]Paul Scoon's mansion and held it for
   an entire day while being attacked by a force of Grenadians and
   Cubans.^[35][2]

   As a SEAL, Chalker also saw action in [36]Haiti (recounted in his book
   One Perfect Op), [37]El Salvador, and
   [38]Panama.^[39][1]^[40][2]^[41][3]

   When Marcinko was tasked to select members for a new unit to test
   security at US Naval Bases against the threat of [42]terrorism, he once
   again chose Chalker as one of the founding members. This unit was
   called [43]Red Cell.^[44][1]

   After Red Cell was disbanded Chalker transitioned back to SEAL Team Six
   and eventually received the assignment to become the Command Master
   Chief at the Training Center Command for BUD/S (Basic Underwater
   Demolition/SEALs) Training in [45]Coronado, California.

   While serving at BUD/S as Command Master Chief, Chalker was hired as a
   technical advisor for [46]The Rock, a 1996 [47]Jerry Bruckheimer
   film.^[48][1] Chalker was also used as an onscreen extra during the
   movie's swim and dive sequences.^[49][1]^[50][2] This led to a position
   as Director of Operations with Global Studies Group, Inc. (GSGI), upon
   his retirement from the US Navy.^[51][4] GSGI is a combination security
   and training company owned by former US Navy SEAL [52]Harry Humphries
   that specializes in bringing modified (civilian version) SpecOps
   tactical skill training to law- enforcement agencies and Hollywood
   movie productions.^[53][4]

   Chalker is also credited for inventing and developing a tactical
   [54]rifle and [55]submachine gun sling known as the Chalker Sling while
   at SEAL Team Six. The Chalker Sling attaches the long gun to the
   shooter via a harness which enables the operator to quickly transition
   to a secondary weapon or perform another task while using both hands
   and keeping the weapon in a close-ready position as the weapon "hangs"
   from the chest, leaving just enough slack to be able to quickly bring
   it to firing position with little effort.^[56][2]

   Since retiring from the Navy, Chalker has authored six books, three
   fiction and three non-fiction with [57]Kevin Dockery about life as a
   Navy SEAL.
