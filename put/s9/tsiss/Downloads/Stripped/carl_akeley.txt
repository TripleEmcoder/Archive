   Carl Akeley.^[15][1]

   Carl Ethan Akeley (19 May 1864 - 18 November 1926) was a
   [16]taxidermist, [17]sculptor, [18]biologist, [19]conservationist,
   [20]inventor, and nature [21]photographer, noted for his contributions
   to American [22]museums, most notably to the [23]American Museum of
   Natural History. He is considered the father of modern
   [24]taxidermy.^[25][2]

   He was born in [26]Clarendon, New York, and grew up on a farm,
   attending school for only three years. He learned [27]taxidermy from
   David Bruce in [28]Brockport, New York, and then entered an
   apprenticeship in taxidermy at [29]Ward's Natural Science Establishment
   in [30]Rochester, New York. In 1886 Akeley moved on to the
   [31]Milwaukee Public Museum (MPM) in [32]Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he
   created the world's first complete museum habitat diorama in 1890.
   While working at the MPM and at [33]Field Museum of Natural History in
   Chicago, he developed his innovative techniques of taxidermy,
   perfecting a "cement gun" for improving exhibits. He later applied this
   method to patch old buildings with concrete, and is today known as the
   inventor of [34]shotcrete.^[35][3]

   Akeley specialized in African [36]mammals, particularly the [37]gorilla
   and the [38]elephant. As a taxidermist, he improved on techniques of
   fitting the skin over a carefully prepared and sculpted form of the
   animal's body, producing very lifelike specimens, with consideration of
   musculature, wrinkles, and veins. He also displayed the specimens in
   groups in a natural setting. Many animals that he preserved he had
   personally collected.

   In 1909 Akeley accompanied [39]Theodore Roosevelt on an expedition to
   [40]Africa and began working at the [41]American Museum of Natural
   History in [42]New York City, where his efforts can still be seen in
   the Akeley African Hall. Akeley joined The Explorers Club in 1912,
   having been sponsored by three of the Club's seven Charter Members:
   Frank Chapman, Henry Collins Walsh, and Marshall Saville. For
   qualifying, Akeley wrote only, "Explorations in Somaliland and British
   East Africa." He became the Club's sixth president in 1917–1918.

   In 1921, eager to learn about [43]gorillas to determine if killing them
   for museum dioramas was justified, Akeley led an expedition to Mt.
   Mikeno in the [44]Virungas at the edge of the then [45]Belgian Congo.
   At that time, gorillas were quite exotic, with very few even in zoos,
   and collecting such animals for educational museum exhibitions was not
   uncommon. In the process of “collecting” several [46]mountain gorillas,
   Akeley’s attitude was fundamentally changed and for the remainder of
   his life he worked for the establishment of a gorilla preserve in the
   [47]Virungas. In 1925, greatly influenced by Akeley, [48]King Albert I
   of Belgium established the [49]Albert National Park, (since renamed
   [50]Virunga National Park). It was Africa's first national park.
   Opposed to hunting them for sport or trophies, he remained an advocate
   of collection for scientific and educational purposes.^[51][4] One of
   the members of his 1921 expedition was six-year-old Alice Hastings
   Bradley, who later wrote science fiction under the name [52]James
   Tiptree, Jr..

   He improved the motion picture [53]camera for working in nature. Akeley
   also wrote several books, including stories for children, and an
   autobiography In Brightest Africa (1920). He was awarded more than
   thirty [54]patents for his inventions.

   Akeley died of a fever in the [55]Congo during his fifth expedition to
   Africa. He is buried in Africa, just miles from where he encountered
   his first gorilla, the “Old Man of Mikeno.”

   His wife, [56]Mary Jobe Akeley, married him two years before he died.
   He had previously been married to [57]Delia J. Akeley (1875–1970) for
   nearly twenty years. Delia Akeley accompanied him on two of his biggest
   and most productive safaris to Africa in 1905 and again in 1909. Delia
   later returned to Africa twice under the auspices of the [58]Brooklyn
   Museum of Arts and Sciences. She organized and led both trips and lived
   for several months in the [59]Ituri Forest with [60]Pygmies.

   The World Taxidermy & Fish Carving Championships awards gold medallions
   that bear Carl Akeley’s likeness—based on a photograph he had taken at
   Stein Photography in Milwaukee—to its “Best in World” winners. There is
   also a Carl Akeley Award for the most artistic mount at the World Show.
   The medallions were sculpted by Floyd Easterman of the Milwaukee Public
   Museum. The Akeley Hall of African Mammals of the [61]American Museum
   of Natural History is named for him.^[62][5]
