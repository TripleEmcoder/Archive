   Paris Theodore (January 9, 1943—November 16, 2006) was an [9]American
   inventor of innovative [10]gun holsters and state-of-the-art

   police departments in the U.S. and abroad, as well as by the fictional
   [13]James Bond.

[[20]edit] Early years

   Theodore was born in [21]New York City on January 9, 1943, his father,
   John, was a sculptor and art professor at The [22]Horace Mann School.
   His mother, Nenette Charisse was a renowned ballet instructor and
   member of a [23]Vaudeville dancing company. Charisse’s second husband
   was Robert Tucker, a Tony-nominated choreographer, and the couple
   raised Theodore from early childhood. Following his graduation from The
   [24]Browning School on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and while still a
   teenager, in the early 1960’s, Theodore supplemented his work as an
   abstract painter by serving as an independent contractor for the
   [25]Central Intelligence Agency. For several years, he performed a
   number of dangerous covert missions for the Agency, many of which
   required him to carry and use handguns. His experience sparked an
   interest in creating special holsters for the concealment of weapons.
   “I was working for Uncle Sam as a freedom fighter until Communism
   imploded on itself,” Theodore said.

   In 1966, at the age of 23, Theodore founded Seventrees Ltd., a company
   that designed and produced gun holsters for professionals who had the
   need to conceal weapons yet access them quickly. Demand among
   undercover investigators and intelligence agents grew quickly for his
   innovative designs and Seventrees was soon awarded several contracts
   from a variety of U.S. agencies. The growing popularity of the holsters
   inspired many imitations by other manufacturers. Even the company’s
   slogan “Unseen in the Best Places” was copied by at least one
   competitor.

   By day, Theodore and his team were manufacturing customized gun
   holsters, while by night, Seventrees’ West 39th Street offices were
   transformed into a clandestine weapons manufacturing operation,
   designing special classified concealment weapons for government
   agencies through a sister company, Armament Systems Procedures
   Corporation (ASP).

[[26]edit] Invention of the ASP

   One of ASP’s first products was a Theodore-designed handgun bearing the
   name of the company. The “[27]ASP,” based on the [28]Smith & Wesson
   Model 39 semi-automatic pistol, featured many innovations: “clear
   grips”—which enabled the user to see the number of unfired rounds
   remaining; the “guttersnipe”—a ground-breaking gun sight designed for
   close range combat; and a “forefinger grip”—today a standard feature on
   the trigger guard of many modern handguns. Theodore’s ASP was the first
   successful service caliber handgun in true pocket pistol size. Its
   arrival inspired a cottage industry of gunsmiths producing unauthorized
   versions of the weapon. This led a the creation of a factory-produced
   version of the ASP that soon became one of the most popular pistols for
   a major gun manufacturer. Shortly thereafter, the entire gun industry
   began producing compact and sub-compact service caliber handguns.

   In 1970, the ASP was featured in The Handgun, by Glaswegian gun expert
   Geoffrey Boothroyd. Boothroyd, the inspiration for “Q,” the
   technologically inventive character who outfitted [29]James Bond with
   his lifesaving gadgets, would, in turn, later inspire [30]Ian Fleming’s
   successor, John Gardner, to replace Bond’s renowned [31]Walther PPK as
   007’s weapon of choice. Beginning with 1984’s Role of Honor, the ASP
   would go on to be featured in 11 James Bond novels. James Bond expert
   James McMahon would later write: “If Bond were a gun, he'd be the ASP.
   Dark, deadly, perfectly suited to his mission.”

[[32]edit] The Quell System

   In 1980, Theodore formed Techpak, a company created to market a combat
   handgun shooting technique he had developed called “Quell.” The Quell
   system included a realistic depiction of close quarter combat, a
   shooting stance, as well as a target designed to enhance the shooter’s
   understanding of the Quell Zone, the area, that when struck, caused the
   instant cessation of movement by a hostile opponent. Quell drew upon
   Theodore’s real-life experience in close quarter combat and the concept
   of a "Quell stop" became standard training for many police departments
   and special agencies throughout the world. Through Quell, he sought to
   educate weapons professionals about the stark reality of close combat
   with handguns. “From the movies we have learned to expect that when
   someone is shot in the arm, he reacts immediately by grabbing it with
   his free hand, wincing, and maybe uttering an ‘Unh!’ When he is shot in
   the chest, a spot of blood appears and he is thrown backwards, usually
   with arms flailing, to land motionless and silent.” Theodore wrote in
   1985, “The truth is that no bullet from a sidearm, no matter what the
   caliber, will bowl a man over.” He described this “knock-down power” as
   “the figment of the collective imagination of Hollywood screenwriters.”

   As a child, Theodore appeared as “Nibs” in NBC’s 1955 broadcast of
   [33]Peter Pan starring [34]Mary Martin. In 1962, Theodore married Lee
   Becker, the Tony-nominated dancer and choreographer and founder of The
   American DanceMachine, who died in 1987. Theodore died November 16,
   2006 at St. Luke’s hospital in [35]Manhattan. The cause of death was
   complications resulting from a longstanding and debilitating bout with
   [36]multiple sclerosis. He is survived by his sons, Ali and Said
   Theodore and Paris Kain. Kain, a filmmaker, is currently producing a
   documentary based on the life of his late father.
