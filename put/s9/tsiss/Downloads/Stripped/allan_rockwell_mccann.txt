[[35]edit] Education to World War I

   Admiral McCann attended Mark Hopkins Grammar School and [36]Drury High
   School in North Adams before his appointment to the [37]United States
   Naval Academy from the First District of Massachusetts in 1913.
   Graduated and commissioned ensign in March 1917, he was assigned to
   [38]USS Kansas (BB-21) on which he served throughout [39]World War I
   and until September 1919. Following instruction in submarines aboard
   [40]USS Fulton (AS-1) at the Submarine Base, [41]New London,
   Connecticut, he joined [42]USS K-6 (SS-37) in January 1920, serving in
   command of that submarine from May to September of that year. Assigned
   duty in connection with fitting out [43]USS S-19 (SS-124), he was
   detached in January 1921 before the commissioning of that submarine. He
   subsequently commanded the submarines [44]USS N-4 (SS-56) and
   [45]USS L-3 (SS-42) until June 1922. He transferred to
   [46]USS R-21 (SS-98) at Coco Solo, Canal Zone, serving in command of
   that submarine until she was decommissioned in June 1924.

   In July 1924, returning to the Submarine Base at New London, he served
   as an Instructor in Diesel Engineering for one year, assigned to
   [47]USS Chewink (AM-39). He then was transferred to duty as Chief
   Engineer and Repair Officer of that Base. In November 1925, he was
   assigned additional duty as technical adviser to the Peruvian Naval
   Commission at the [48]Electric Boat Company, [49]Groton, Connecticut,
   and when detached in October 1926, he commanded the submarine
   [50]USS S-46 (SS-157), based on Coco Solo, Canal Zone, until May 1929.
   He then served in the Design Division, later in the Maintenance
   Division, Bureau of Construction and Repair (now [51]Bureau of Ships),
   Navy Department, Washington, DC, for two years, July 1929-1931. During
   that tour of duty he was assigned to diving operations in connection
   with development of submarine escape apparatus, and was in charge of
   the development of a submarine rescue chamber, which bears his name,
   "The [52]McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber". Additionally he was assigned
   as Liaison Officer / Engineer when the submarine [53]USS O-12 (SS-73)
   was converted for use in the under ice attempt to circumnavigate the
   Arctic Ice cap and voyage to the North Pole. Modifications to the
   submarine were extensive, and contained innovations of a telescoping
   conning tower, an ice drill, an incorporated diving bell and an Air
   Lock, designed by [54]Simon Lake. The submarine was designated Nautilus
   and leased for one dollar to [55]Lake and Dannenhower, Inc., of
   [56]Bridgeport, Connecticut, for use on [57]Hubert Wilkins's and
   [58]Lincoln Ellsworth's Arctic Expedition.

   From August 1931 until June 1934, he commanded the submarine
   [59]USS Bonita (SS-165). He had consecutive duty with the [60]Board of
   Inspection and Survey, Pacific Coast Section, at San Francisco,
   California, and at Long Beach, California. He joined
   [61]USS Indianapolis (CA-35) in April 1936, and served as First
   Lieutenant and Damage Control Officer of that cruiser until June 1937.
   Transferred to duty as Damage Control Officer on the staff of Commander
   Cruisers, [62]Scouting Force, [63]USS Chicago (CA-29), he served in
   that assignment until June 1938.

   Returning to the [64]Navy Department in July 1938, he reported for duty
   as Planning Officer, Personnel Division, Bureau of Navigation (now
   [65]Bureau of Naval Personnel), and in May 1939 was ordered to duty in
   connection with the [66]USS Sailfish (SS-192) accident, sunk during a
   trial dive off [67]Portsmouth, New Hampshire. As a member of the
   Squalus Salvage Unit, he played an important part in the rescue of 33
   survivors and the salvage of the stricken submarine. He received a
   "Well Done" commendation from the [68]President of the United States
   for the success of this extremely difficult operation. It utilized the
   McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber he and Commander [69]Charles B. 'Swede'
   Momsen had designed 10 years earlier.

[[70]edit] World War II and Post War

   When detached from the Navy Department in April 1941, he assumed duty
   in May as Commander, Submarine Squadron 6, [71]Pacific Fleet, and was
   serving in that command when the United States entered [72]World War II
   in December 1941. In January 1943 he was assigned additional duty in
   temporary command of Task Force 51 ([73]Perth, Australia) and as Senior
   Representative of Commander Submarines Southwest Pacific. For his
   services in those assignments he was awarded the [74]Legion of Merit.

   In April 1943, he had orders transferring him to duty as Commander,
   Submarine Squadron 7, in the Atlantic, a command which utilized
   captured foreign submarines to train [75]US Navy Sailors in
   [76]Anti-submarine warfare techniques, and in September 1943 he
   returned to the United States. He was assigned for a tour of shore duty
   in the Fleet Maintenance Division, Office of the Chief of Naval
   Operations, Navy Department, and served until July 1944. He was given
   command of the battleship [77]USS Iowa (BB-61) and from August 16, to
   November 28, 1944 was in the Western Pacific. The [78]Bronze Star was
   awarded to him for actions in the invasion of the Philippines.

   In December 1944 he reported to Headquarters, Commander in Chief, US
   Fleet, Navy Department, and was assigned as his Assistant Chief of
   Staff (Anti-Submarine), and Chief of Staff to the Commander, [79]Tenth
   Fleet, serving under immediate direction of [80]Fleet Admiral
   [81]Ernest J. King. The Tenth Fleet, a fleet without a ship, was a
   highly specialized intelligence command, able to call upon the surface
   and air forces of the [82]Atlantic Fleet and the Sea Frontier Forces as
   needed for special assignments, and was organized to exercise unity of
   control over the Navy's war against [83]U-boat operations in the
   Atlantic from Iceland to Cape Horn. The Tenth Fleet was dissolved in
   June 1945, and Rear Admiral McCann was transferred to duty on the staff
   of the Commander in Chief, [84]Atlantic Fleet, and was subsequently
   designated Commander, Task Force 68, in the light cruiser
   [85]USS Philadelphia (CL-41) during the Presidential trip to [86]Berlin
   for the [87]Potsdam Conference, July 4, to August 8, 1945. He
   personally reported to [88]President [89]Harry S. Truman the news of
   the successful atomic bombing of [90]Hiroshima, [91]Japan.

   He was commended by [92]President [93]Harry S. Truman on August 7, 1945
   for completing this most important mission, and for this duty he was
   awarded a Letter of Commendation with Ribbon by the Commander in Chief,
   Atlantic Fleet. He also was awarded a [94]Gold Star in lieu of a second
   Legion of Merit.

   He again served as Assistant Chief of Staff (Operations), on the staff
   of the Commander in Chief, US Fleet, from August 20, to October 10,
   1945. In accordance with the reorganization of the Navy resulting from
   [95]Executive Order 9635 of September 29, 1945, his title was changed
   to Head, Fleet Operations Section, Operations Division, under the
   Office of the [96]Chief of Naval Operations, [97]Navy Department. On
   December 18, 1945, he assumed duty as Commander, Submarine Force,
   [98]Pacific Fleet, aboard light cruiser [99]USS Fargo (CL-106) at the
   Submarine Base, [100]Pearl Harbor, [101]Territory of Hawaii.

   As [102]Commander Submarines Pacific, he was the commander of the first
   under-ice [103]sonar testing missions off the [104]Bering Strait,
   beginning July 30, 1947. Aboard the submarine
   [105]USS Boarfish (SS-327), he made excursions with Dr. [106]Waldo K.
   Lyon under the polar ice cap as far north as 72 degrees 15' north
   latitude.

   On September 3, 1948, he reported as a Member of the [107]General Board
   of the Navy Department, and on June 14, 1949 he transferred to duty as
   [108]Inspector General, Navy Department, where he was tasked by
   President [109]Harry S. Truman to investigate the [110]Revolt of the
   Admirals. He was so serving when he was transferred to the Retired List
   of the Navy on May 1, 1950, and advanced in rank to [111]Vice Admiral
   upon retirement, because of past combat citations.

[[112]edit] Death

   Allan R. McCann died on February 22, 1978 at the US Navy Hospital at
   [113]San Diego, California, and was buried at sea by the US Navy
   Submarine detachment, San Diego.
