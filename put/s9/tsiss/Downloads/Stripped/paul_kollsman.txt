   Paul Kollsman (February 22, 1900 in [15]Germany – March 17, 1982 in
   [16]Beverly Hills, California) was an American inventor. He invented
   barometers and instruments for [17]instrument flight in airplanes.

   Kollsman studied [18]civil engineering in [19]Stuttgart and [20]Munich.
   In 1923 he emigrated from Germany to the [21]USA. He worked as
   truck-driver until he found a position at Pioneer Instruments Co. in
   [22]Brooklyn/[23]New York. In 1928 he founded his own company, Kollsman
   Instruments Co., with $500 of seed money.

   He was searching for the right opportunity to launch his product a long
   time until [24]Jimmy Doolittle flight tested his instruments. His
   instruments were later used in the [25]NASA [26]Apollo program. The
   altimeter setting window of the sensitive aircraft [27]altimeter is
   named the "Kollsman Window" after him.

   In 1939, Kollsman, who was then residing in Greenwich, Conn., sold his
   company for more than $4,000,000. In 1940 he purchased 800 acres (3.2
   km^2) of land outside of Manchester Vermont from International Paper
   Company, and founded Snow Valley, which formally opened in January
   1942, and was one of the earliest ski areas in the United States. Snow
   Valley operated continuously until 1984, and in 1983 hosted the first
   U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships (now held annually at Stratton
   Vermont). Snow Valley is being redeveloped as a private sporting
   community.

   In 1944 Kollsman married Baroness Julie Dorothea Baronin von
   Bodenhausen in New York City. In 1945 Kollsman purchased The Enchanted
   Hill, a fabulous estate in Beverly Hills, California, which contained a
   Mediterranean Revival main house of 10,000 square feet (with 12 acres
   (49,000 m^2) of formal gardens) which Mr. Kollsman eventually augmented
   to 120 acres (0.49 km^2), designed by acclaimed architect Wallace Neff.
   The estate, which was described by architectural historian Sam Watters
   as “fantastical”, had been built in 1925 at the top of Angelo Drive by
   MGM screenwriter Frances Marion and her cowboy-star husband, Frederick
   Clifton Thomson. Among other features, the estate included a
   mahogany-floored stable for Thomson’s horse "Silver King". It was
   considered one of the finest estates in all of Los Angeles, and has
   been called a “poetic hilltop paradise, a timeless homage to the
   natural beauty that was once Los Angeles.” Microsoft co-founder Paul
   Allen acquired the estate from Kollsman’s widow in 1997 for $20 million
   and razed the landmark house in 2000, with plans to build two
   50,000-square-foot (4,600 m^2) mansions in its place.

   Kollsman died in Beverly Hills, California in 1982.
