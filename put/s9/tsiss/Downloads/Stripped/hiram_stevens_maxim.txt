   Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim (February 5, 1840 – November 24, 1916) was an
   [15]inventor born in the U.S. who emigrated to [16]England and adopted
   [17]British citizenship. He was the inventor of the [18]Maxim Gun – the
   first portable, fully automatic [19]machine gun – and the ubiquitous
   [20]mousetrap. He patented the first silencing device for a firearm,
   and laid a claim to inventing the [21]lightbulb. He also experimented
   with powered flight, but his large aircraft designs were never
   successful. However, his "Captive Flying Machine" [22]amusement ride,
   designed as a means by which to fund his research while generating
   public interest in flight, was highly successful.

[[38]edit] Birth

   Maxim was born in [39]Sangerville, Maine in the [40]United States of
   America. He became an apprentice [41]coachbuilder at the age of 14 and
   ten years later took up a job at the machine works of his uncle, Levi
   Stephens, at [42]Fitchburg, Massachusetts. He subsequently worked as an
   instrument maker and as a draughtsman.

[[43]edit] Family

   His brother, [44]Hudson Maxim, was also a military inventor,
   specializing in [45]explosives.

   He married his first wife, Jane Budden, in 1867. Their children were:
   [46]Hiram Percy Maxim; Florence Maxim, who married George Albert
   Cutter, and Adelaide Maxim, who married Eldon Joubert, [47]Ignacy Jan
   Paderewski's piano tuner.^[48][1]

   Hiram Percy Maxim followed in his father's and uncle's footsteps and
   became a mechanical engineer and weapons designer as well, but he is
   perhaps best known for his early [49]amateur radio experiments and for
   founding the [50]American Radio Relay League. His invention of the
   "Maxim Silencer" for noise [51]suppression came too late to save his
   father's hearing.^[52][2]

   He married his second wife, Sarah, daughter of Charles Hayes of Boston,
   in 1881. It is not clear if he was legally divorced from his first wife
   at this time.

[[53]edit] Emigration

   Maxim emigrated to England in 1881^[[54]citation needed] and became a
   [55]naturalized [56]Briton in 1899. [57]Queen Victoria [58]knighted
   Maxim in 1901 for his inventions, many of which had military
   applications.

[[59]edit] Profession

   Maxim was a [60]Chevalier of the Legion of Honour; a Civil, Mechanical
   and Electrical Engineer; Member of the [61]London Chamber of Commerce;
   Member of the [62]Royal Institution; Member of the [63]British
   Association for the Advancement of Science; Member of the [64]British
   Empire League; and Member of the [65]Royal Society of Arts.^[66][3]

[[67]edit] The Maxim machine gun

   Further information: [68]Maxim gun

   Maxim was reported to have said: "In 1882 I was in Vienna, where I met
   an American whom I had known in the States. He said: 'Hang your
   chemistry and electricity! If you want to make a pile of money, invent
   something that will enable these Europeans to cut each others' throats
   with greater facility.'"^[71][4]

   As a child, Maxim had been knocked over by a rifle's recoil, and this
   inspired him to use that recoil force to automatically operate a gun.
   Between 1883 and 1885 Maxim patented gas, recoil and blow-back methods
   of operation. After moving to England, he settled in a large house
   formerly owned by [72]Lord Thurlow in [73]West Norwood where he
   developed his design for an automatic weapon, using an action that
   would close the breech and compress a spring, by storing the recoil
   energy released by a shot to prepare the gun for its next shot. He
   thoughtfully ran announcements in the local press warning that he would
   be experimenting with the gun in his garden and that neighbours should
   keep their windows open to avoid the danger of broken glass.^[74][5]

   Maxim founded an armaments company to produce his machine gun in
   [75]Crayford, [76]Kent, which later merged with Nordenfeldt and the
   [77]Vickers Corporation in 1896, becoming 'Vickers, Son & Maxim'. Their
   updated design, referred to as the [78]Vickers gun after Maxim's
   resignation from the board in 1911 on his 71st birthday, was the
   standard British machine gun for many years. With arms sales led by
   [79]Basil Zaharoff, variants of the Maxim gun were bought and used
   extensively by both sides during [80]World War I.

   In his later years Maxim became profoundly deaf, as his hearing had
   been damaged by years of exposure to the noise of his guns.^[81][6]

[[82]edit] Inventions

   Maxim is also credited with inventing the common mousetrap and, as a
   long-time sufferer from [83]bronchitis, he also patented and
   manufactured a pocket [84]menthol [85]inhaler and a larger "Pipe of
   Peace", a steam inhaler using [86]pine vapour, that he claimed could
   relieve [87]asthma, [88]tinnitus, [89]hay fever and
   [90]catarrh.^[91][7] After being criticised for applying his talents to
   [92]quackery, he protested that: "it will be seen that it is a very
   creditable thing to invent a killing machine, and nothing less than a
   disgrace to invent an apparatus to prevent human suffering".^[93][4]

   He also invented a curling iron, an apparatus for demagnetizing
   watches, magno-electric machines, devices to prevent the rolling of
   ships, eyelet and riveting machines, aircraft artillery, an aerial
   torpedo gun, coffee substitutes, and various oil, steam, and gas
   engines.^[94][8]

   Maxim developed and installed the first electric lights in a New York
   City building (the [95]Equitable Insurance Company Building at 120
   [96]Broadway) in the late 1870s.^[97][4] However, he was involved in
   several lengthy patent disputes with [98]Thomas Edison over his claims
   to the [99]lightbulb. One of these actions regarded the
   [100]incandescent bulb, for which Maxim claimed that Edison was
   credited by means of his better understanding of [101]patenting law
   (though in England [102]Joseph Wilson Swan had already obtained the
   first patent in 1878). He claimed an employee of his (Maxim's) had
   falsely patented the invention under his own name, and that Edison
   proved the employee's claim to be false, knowing that patent law would
   mean the invention would become public property, allowing Edison to
   manufacture the lightbulb without crediting Maxim as the true inventor.

[[103]edit] Flying machines

   Maxim's flying machine

   Maxim's father had earlier conceived of a helicopter powered by two
   counter-rotating rotors, but was unable to find a powerful enough
   engine to build it. Hiram first sketched out plans for a helicopter in
   1872, but when he built his first "flying machine" he chose to use
   wings. Commencing work in 1889, he built a 145 feet (44 m) long craft
   that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110 feet (34 m) wingspan that was powered
   by two compound 360 horsepower (270 kW) [104]steam engines driving two
   propellers. In trials at [105]Bexley in 1894 his machine rode on
   1,800 feet (550 m) of rails and was prevented from rising by outriggers
   underneath and wooden safety rails overhead, somewhat in the manner of
   a roller coaster.^[106][9] His apparent goal in building this machine
   was not to soar freely, but to test if it would lift off the ground.
   During its test run all of the outriggers were engaged, showing that it
   had developed enough lift to take off, but in so doing it damaged the
   track; the "flight" was aborted in time to prevent disaster. The craft
   was almost certainly aerodynamically unstable and uncontrollable, which
   Maxim probably realized, because he subsequently abandoned work on
   it.^[107][10]

[[108]edit] Captive Flying Machines

   The Sir Hiram Maxim Captive Flying Machines operating at [109]Blackpool
   Pleasure Beach in 2006

   In order to both fund his research into flight and to popularise the
   notion of flight, Maxim designed and built an amusement ride for the
   [110]Earl's Court exhibition of 1904. The ride was based on a test rig
   he had devised for his research, and consisted of a large spinning
   frame from which cars hung captive. As the machine spun, the cars would
   be swung outward through the air, simulating flight. The ride was
   similar to the later [111]Circle Swing ride, popularised in the
   [112]USA by renowned roller coaster designer [113]Harry Traver.

   Maxim originally intended to use primitive aerofoils and wings to allow
   riders to control their flight, but this was outlawed as unsafe. As a
   result, Maxim quickly lost interest in the project, declaring the
   adapted ride as "Simply a glorified merry-go-round". Nevertheless, his
   company built several more rides of various sizes at [114]The Crystal
   Palace and various seaside resorts including [115]Southport, [116]New
   Brighton, and [117]Blackpool, all of which opened in 1904. Originally
   Maxim had only intended to build two, but a lengthy breakdown on the
   original Earl's Court ride forced him to build more in order to make
   the venture profitable. He had plans for further variations of the ride
   but his disillusionment with the amusement business meant that they
   were never realised.

   Although he expressed regrets about the whole project, the rides were
   held in high regard within the amusement industry and the Blackpool
   ride still operates to this day as part of what is now the
   [118]Pleasure Beach amusement park. Along with the same park's
   similarly historic [119]River Caves, it is the oldest operating
   amusement ride in Europe. The Flying Machines has the distinction of
   being virtually unchanged from Maxim's original design. The Blackpool
   ride's name is now usually abbreviated to the "Flying Machine" or
   "Flying Machines", although the full name, "Sir Hiram Maxim's Captive
   Flying Machines", is given at the ride entrance.

   In 2001 [120]Disney's California Adventure opened, featuring the
   [121]Golden Zephyr, a modern day recreation of the Traver version of
   the ride. The ride itself is much smaller than the Blackpool version
   with cars swinging out to a much less severe angle. Nevertheless,
   engineers from Disney visited Blackpool to inspect the Maxim ride (the
   only example of either version still standing) in order to help design
   their ride.

[[122]edit] Grahame-White, Blériot, and Maxim Company

   In 1911 he headed the newly formed [123]Grahame-White, [124]Blériot,
   and Maxim Company, founded with the two aviators and two hundred
   thousand pounds of capital.^[125][11] He had hoped to produce military
   aircraft capable of scouting or dropping a 500 lb (230 kg) bomb, but
   his failing health and financial difficulties with his other
   enterprises restricted his ability to develop this enterprise before
   his death.^[126][12]

[[127]edit] Philosophy and Religion

   In addition to his Civil, Mechanical and Electrical endeavours, Maxim
   "compiled and edited" a book he titled "Li Hung Chang's
   Scrapbook".^[128][3] This book was addressed to [129]Li Hung Chang
   (also spelled Li Hongzhang and Li Hung-chang) and endeavoured to
   address a belief that "The Chinese were generally puzzled as to how it
   was possible for people who are able to build locomotives and
   steamships to have a religion based on a belief in devils, ghosts,
   impossible miracles, and all the other absurdities and impossibilities
   peculiar to the religion taught by the missionaries" (Op. cit. Foreword
   page x).

   Maxim held European [130]missionaries in China in low esteem, for
   reasons described in the scrap-book. He stated "...it was my aim, in
   compiling for His Excellency a scrap-book with explanatory notes, to
   put the Chinaman right in this respect. I wished to show that we were
   not all fools." (Op.cit. Foreword page x). His scrap-book comprised
   some 400 pages with 42 illustrations, presenting his views on The
   Nature of Christianity; Christianity in China; and his conclusions on
   subjects including Miracles, Spirituality, Faith; and the influence of
   the Bible on the civilization of Europe and America. He concluded his
   scrap-book with an appeal to the Missionaries and his thoughts on the
   reason for the failure of what he described as "Missionary Propaganda"
   in China.

[[131]edit] Death

   Maxim died in [132]London and is buried in [133]West Norwood Cemetery.
