   1890) was an American [15]inventor who invented the first practical
   [16]typewriter and the [17]QWERTY keyboard still in use today.^[18][3]
   He was also a newspaper publisher and Wisconsin politician.

[[25]edit] Youth and political career

   Born in [26]Mooresburg, Pennsylvania, Sholes moved to nearby
   [27]Danville as a teenager, where he worked as an [28]apprentice to a
   [29]printer. After completing his [30]apprenticeship, Sholes moved to
   [31]Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1837. He became a [32]newspaper
   [33]publisher and [34]politician, serving in the [35]Wisconsin State
   Senate 1848-1849, 1856–1857, and the [36]Wisconsin State Assembly
   1852-1853.^[37][4]^[38][5] He was instrumental in the successful
   movement to abolish [39]capital punishment in Wisconsin: his newspaper,
   The Kenosha Telegraph, reported on the trial of [40]John McCaffary in
   1851, and then in 1853 he led the campaign in the Wisconsin State
   Assembly.^[41][6] He was the younger brother of [42]Charles Sholes
   (1816–1867) who was a newspaper publisher and politician who served in
   both houses of the Wisconsin State Legislature and as mayor of
   [43]Kenosha, Wisconsin.^[44][7]

[[45]edit] The "Voree plates"

   In 1845, Sholes was working as editor of the Southport Telegraph, a
   small newspaper in [46]Kenosha, Wisconsin. During this time he heard
   about the alleged discovery of the [47]Voree Record, a set of three
   minuscule [48]brass plates unearthed by [49]James J. Strang, a would-be
   successor to the murdered [50]Mormon prophet [51]Joseph Smith,
   Jr..^[52][8] Strang asserted that this proved that he was a true
   [53]prophet of God, and he invited the public to call upon him and see
   the plates for themselves. Sholes accordingly visited Strang, examined
   his "Voree Record," and wrote an article about their meeting. He
   indicated that while he could not accept Strang's plates or his
   prophetic claims, Strang himself seemed to be "honest and earnest" and
   his disciples were "among the most honest and intelligent men in the
   neighborhood." As for the "record" itself, Sholes indicated that he was
   "content to have no opinion about it."^[54][9]

[[55]edit] Inventing the typewriter

   Main article: [56]Sholes and Glidden typewriter
   John Pratt's Pterotype, the inspiration for Sholes in July 1867.
   [57]Wisconsin Historical Marker

   Typewriters had been invented as early as 1714 by [58]Henry Mill and
   reinvented in various forms throughout the 1800s. It was to be Sholes,
   however, who invented the first one to be commercially successful.

   Sholes had moved to [59]Milwaukee and became the editor of a newspaper.
   Following a strike by compositors at his printing press, he tried
   building a machine for [60]typesetting, but this was a failure and he
   quickly abandoned the idea. He arrived at the typewriter through a
   different route. His initial goal was to create a machine to number
   pages of a book, tickets, and so on. He began work on this at
   Kleinsteubers machine shop in Milwaukee, together with a fellow printer
   [61]Samuel W. Soule, and they [62]patented a numbering machine on
   November 13, 1866.^[63][10]

   Sholes and Soule showed their machine to [64]Carlos Glidden, a lawyer
   and amateur inventor at the machine shop working on a mechanical plow,
   who wondered if the machine could not be made to produce letters and
   words as well. Further inspiration came in July 1867, when Sholes came
   across a short note in [65]Scientific American^[66][11] describing the
   "Pterotype", a prototype typewriter that had been invented by [67]John
   Pratt. From the description, Sholes decided that the pterotype was too
   complex and set out to make his own machine, whose name he got from the
   article: the typewriting machine, or typewriter.

   For this project, Soule was again enlisted, and Glidden joined them as
   a third partner who provided the funds. The Scientific American article
   (unillustrated) had figuratively used the phrase "literary piano"; the
   first model that the trio built had a keyboard literally resembling a
   piano. It had black keys and white keys, laid out in two rows. It did
   not contain keys for the numerals 0 or 1 because the letters O and I
   were deemed sufficient:
  3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M

   with the first row made of [68]ivory and the second of [69]ebony, the
   rest of the framework being wooden. It was in this form that Sholes,
   Glidden and Soule were granted patents for their invention on June 23,
   1868^[70][12] and July 14.^[71][13] The first document to be produced
   on a typewriter was a contract that Sholes had written, in his capacity
   as the Comptroller for the city of Milwaukee. Machines similar to
   Sholes's had been previously used by the blind for embossing, but by
   Sholes's time the inked ribbon had been invented, which made
   typewriting in its current form possible.^[72][10]

   At this stage, the Sholes-Glidden-Soule typewriter was only one among
   dozens of similar inventions. They wrote hundreds of letters on their
   machine to various people, one of whom was [73]James Densmore of
   [74]Meadville, Pennsylvania. Densmore foresaw that the typewriter would
   be highly profitable, and offered to buy a share of the patent, without
   even having laid eyes on the machine. The trio immediately sold him
   one-fourth of the patent in return for his paying all their expenses so
   far. When Densmore eventually examined the machine in March 1867, he
   declared that it was good for nothing in its current form, and urged
   them to start improving it. Discouraged, Soule and Glidden left the
   project, leaving Sholes and Densmore in sole possession of the patent.

   Realizing that [75]stenographers would be among the first and most
   important users of the machine, and therefore best in a position to
   judge its suitability, they sent experimental versions to a few
   stenographers. The most important of them was [76]James O. Clephane, of
   [77]Washington D.C., who tried the instruments as no one else had tried
   them, subjecting them to such unsparing tests that he destroyed them,
   one after another, as fast as they could be made and sent to him. His
   judgments were similarly caustic, causing Sholes to lose his patience
   and temper. But Densmore insisted that this was exactly what they
   needed:^[78][10]^[79][14]

   "This candid fault-finding is just what we need. We had better have it
   now than after we begin manufacturing. Where Clephane points out a weak
   lever or rod let us make it strong. Where a spacer or an inker works
   stiffly, let us make it work smoothly. Then, depend upon Clephane for
   all the praise we deserve."

   Sholes typewriter, 1873. Museum, [80]Buffalo and Erie County Historical
   Society.

   Sholes took this advice and set to improve the machine at every
   iteration, until they were satisfied that Clephane had taught them
   everything he could. By this time, they had manufactured 50 machines or
   so, at an average cost of $250. They decided to have the machine
   examined by an expert mechanic, who directed them to [81]E. Remington
   and Sons (which later became the Remington Arms Company), manufacturers
   of firearms, sewing machines, and farm tools. In early 1873 they
   approached Remington, who decided to buy the patent from them. Sholes
   sold his half for $12,000, while Densmore, still a stronger believer in
   the machine, insisted on a royalty, which would eventually fetch him
   $1.5 million.^[82][10]

   Sholes returned to Milwaukee and continued to work on new improvements
   for the typewriter throughout the 1870s, which included the [83]QWERTY
   keyboard (1873).^[84][15] [85]James Densmore had suggested splitting up
   commonly used letter combinations in order to solve a jamming problem
   caused by the slow method of recovering from a keystroke: weights, not
   springs, returned all parts to the "rest" position. This concept was
   later refined by Sholes and the resulting QWERTY layout is still used
   today on both typewriters and English language computer keyboards,
   although the jamming problem no longer exists.

   Sholes died on February 17, 1890 after battling [86]tuberculosis for
   nine years, and is buried at [87]Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.
