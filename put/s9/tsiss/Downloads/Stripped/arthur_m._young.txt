    Born  3 November 1905 (1905-11-03)

   Arthur Middleton Young (November 3, 1905 – May 30, 1995) was an
   American [12]inventor, helicopter pioneer, [13]cosmologist,
   [14]philosopher, [15]astrologer and author. Young was the designer of
   [16]Bell Helicopter's first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of
   the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell's early helicopter designs. He
   founded the "Institute for the Study of Consciousness" in [17]Berkeley
   in 1972. Young advocated a [18]process theory, which is a form of
   [19]integral theory. These theories attempt to integrate the realm of
   human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the
   concept of [20]universe is not limited to that which can be physically
   measured. Young's theory embraces [21]evolution and the concept of the
   [22]great chain of being. He has influenced such thinkers as
   [23]Stanislav Grof.

[[35]edit] Biography

   Arthur was the son of Eliza Coxe (1875–1950) and [36]Philadelphia
   landscape painter Charles Morris Young (1869–1964). He was interested
   in developing a comprehensive theory of [37]reality from an early age.
   He felt that to acquire the intellectual tools needed for such rigorous
   study, he should first develop an understanding of [38]mathematics and
   engineering. With this decision he was following a career path similar
   to that of philosopher [39]Alfred North Whitehead, who was a
   mathematician before he developed the first process philosophy. Thus
   after graduation from [40]Princeton University in 1927 Young searched
   for a suitable invention to develop. In 1928 he returned to his
   father's farm in [41]Radnor, Pennsylvania to begin twelve solitary
   years of efforts to develop the [42]helicopter into a useful device.

   Young's private experiments with helicopter design had mostly involved
   small scale models. After twelve years on his own using the models, he
   took his results and models to the [43]Bell Aircraft Company in
   [44]Buffalo, New York, in 1941, and the company agreed to build
   full-scale prototypes. While war was looming for the USA in late 1941
   he was issued the key rotor stabilizer bar (also known as a [45]flybar)
   patent, assigned it to Bell and moved to Buffalo to work with them. In
   June 1942 he moved his five-person team to [46]Gardenville, New York, a
   hamlet on the north border of [47]West Seneca, New York, where they
   could work in relative secrecy. The first test flight of the prototype
   Model 30 occurred in July 1943, and on March 8, 1946 the company
   received Helicopter Type Certificate H-1 for the world's first
   commercial helicopter, the [48]Bell Model 47. This was the "whirlybird"
   featured in the [49]M*A*S*H movie and television series and was so
   successful that it continued to be manufactured through 1974. A design
   as well as a utilitarian success, it was added to the permanent
   collection of the [50]Museum of Modern Art of [51]New York in 1984.

   Young had become profoundly disturbed by the development of nuclear
   weapons at the end of the Second World War and, like a number of other
   very forward-looking and independent thinkers, decided that humanity
   needed a new philosophical paradigm.

   In August 1946 Young recorded in his notes the idea of the psychopter—
   the helicopter as the "winged self", a metaphor for the human
   [52]spirit.^[53][1] By October 1947 Young felt his work at Bell was
   complete, and he turned to the next phase of his career as a
   philosopher of mind (or soul). In 1949, he was awarded the [54]Edward
   Longstreth Medal. In 1952, Young and his wife Ruth organized the
   Foundation for the Study of Consciousness in [55]Philadelphia, the
   forerunner of the Institute for the Study of Consciousness.

[[56]edit] Marriages

   Young married Priscilla Page in 1933. He was divorced from Priscilla in
   1948, and later that year, married artist Ruth Forbes (1903–1998) of
   the [57]Boston [58]Forbes family, a great-granddaughter of [59]Ralph
   Waldo Emerson and the mother of [60]Michael Paine.

[[61]edit] Death

   On 30 May 1995, Arthur Young died of cancer at age 89, at his home in
   Berkeley, California.^[62][2]

[[63]edit] Philosophical views

   In 1976, Young's theory of evolution of life on Earth — which attempted
   to synthesize understandings from [64]geology, [65]biology,
   [66]anthropology, [67]psychology, and [68]parapsychology — appeared
   under the title The Reflexive Universe. Young accepted the general
   "theory of evolution," but pointed out where he felt the Darwinian
   theory was insufficient to the facts. The book also incorporates a
   brief speculative discussion of further human psychological and
   spiritual growth.^[69][3]
