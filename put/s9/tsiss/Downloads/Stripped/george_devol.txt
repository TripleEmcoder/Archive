[[22]edit] Biography

   Born in [23]Louisville, Kentucky in 1912, Devol was interested from
   boyhood in all things electrical and mechanical such as boats,
   airplanes, and engines.

   He got some practical experience at [24]Riordan Prep, where, in
   addition to studying traditional subjects, he helped construct some
   buildings and run the school's electric light plant. Although he wasn't
   very scholarly he read everything he could about mechanical devices,
   trying to discover what, besides building radios, could be done with
   vacuum tubes when applied as control devices.

[[25]edit] United Cinephone

   Choosing to forego higher education, in 1932 Devol went into business,
   forming [27]United Cinephone Corp. to produce variable area recording
   directly onto film for the new sound motion pictures ("talkies").
   However, he later learned that companies like RCA and Western Electric
   were working in the same area, and decided to discontinue the product.
   Phantom Doorman [28]Automatic Door

   At that time, Devol asked himself "what else can we do with all these
   photocells and vacuum tubes?"

   United Cinephone manufactured Devol's invention, the "Phantom Doorman"
   photoelectric door, which were sold to Yale & Towne. This was the first
   automatic opening door, now ubiquitous in grocery stores and elsewhere.
   The Company manufactured many other products using photoelectric cells
   and vacuum tube control systems. Among these was a very early bar code
   system which was used for sorting packages at the Railway Express
   Company, years before others would separately come up with similar
   technology.

   Orthoplane Lighting

   United Cinephone also manufactured Orthoplane lighting, another product
   Devol patented, for garment factories. United Cinephone also created
   revolutionary registration controls for printing presses and packaging
   machinery. The company also manufactured phonograph arms and
   amplifiers. In fact, Devol installed amplifiers at the [30]Cotton Club
   and enjoyed watching [31]Count Basie, [32]Fred Waring and others,
   occasionally taking in the after-hours jam sessions.

   In 1939 United Cinephone installed automated photoelectric counters at
   New York World's Fair to count customers entering the fairgrounds.

[[33]edit] World War II

   Around the time the [34]World War II began, Devol sold his interest in
   United Cinephone and approached Sperry Gyroscope to see if they were
   interested in his ideas on radar technology. He was retained by Sperry
   as manager of the Special Projects Department that developed radar
   devices and microwave test equipment.

   In 1939, Devol applied for a patent for proximity controls for use in
   laundry press machines, based on a radio frequency field. This control
   would automatically open and close laundry presses when workers
   approached the machines. Once the War began, Devol was advised by the
   patent office that his patent application would be placed on hold for
   the duration of the conflict.

   Later in the war, he approached Auto Ordinance Company regarding
   products that company could produce aside from their primary product
   line, which were Thompson machine guns. Devol told them that the field
   of radar counter-measures was about to emerge as an urgently needed
   defense technology.

   In 1943, he organized General Electronics Industries in Greenwich, CT
   as a subsidiary of the Auto Ordinance Corporation. General Electronics
   produced counter-radar devices until the end of the War. General
   Electronics was one of the largest producers of radar and radar
   counter-measure equipment for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army Air Force and
   other government agencies. The company's radar counter-measure systems
   were on allied planes on D-Day.

   Over a difference of opinion regarding the future of certain projects,
   Devol resigned from Auto Ordinnce and joined RCA. After a short stint
   as eastern sales manager of electronics products, which he felt "wasn't
   his ball of wax", Devol left RCA to develop ideas which eventually led
   to the patent application for the first industrial robot. In 1946 he
   applied for a patent on a magnetic recording system for controlling
   machines and a digital playback device for machines. (2)

[[35]edit] Other post-war work

   Speedy Weeny Automatic Hot Dog Machine

   Devol was part of the team that developed the first commercial use of
   microwave oven technology, the Speedy Weeny, which automatically cooked
   and dispensed hotdogs in places such as [36]Grand Central Station.

   In the early 1950s, Devol licensed his digital magnetic recording
   device to Remington Rand of Norwalk, CT and became manager of their
   magnetics department. There he worked with a team to develop his
   magnetic recording system for business data applications. He also
   worked on developing the first high-speed printing systems. While the
   magnetic recording system proved too slow for business data, Devol's
   invention was re-purposed as a machine control that would eventually
   become the "brains" of the Unimate robot.

[[37]edit] The first industrial robot: Unimate

   Main article: [38]Unimate
   Photo of the first static magnetic recorder which used a saw blade to
   record information

   In the 1940s, Devol wasn't thinking about robots. Instead, he was
   focusing on manipulators and his patent on [39]magnetic recording
   devices. He felt the world was ready for new ideas as he saw the
   introduction of automation into factories during this time. With the
   development of the computer and the invention of the transistor in the
   late 1940s, most of the ingredients for an industrial robot were
   available.^[40][2]

   With this new technology in place, Devol worked on his invention. In
   1954, he applied for patent No. 2,988,237 for Universal Automation or
   [41]Unimation, which was issued in 1961. At the suggestion of Devol's
   wife, Evelyn, the word "Unimate" was coined to define the product much
   the same as [42]George Eastman had coined [43]Kodak.^[44][3]
   Original Robot Patent

   When he filed the patent for a programmable method for transferring
   articles, he wrote, "the present invention makes available for the
   first time a more or less general purpose machine that has universal
   application to a vast diversity of applications where cyclic digital
   control is desired."

   After applying for this seminal patent, Devol searched for a company
   willing to give him financial backing to develop his programmable
   articles transfer system. He talked with many major corporations in the
   [45]United States during his search. Then Devol met Joseph F.
   Engelberger at a cocktail party. Engelberger, at that time, was chief
   of engineering in the aircraft products division at [46]Manning,
   Maxwell and Moore in [47]Stratford, Connecticut. Engelberger was very
   interested, and Devol agreed to sell Manning, Maxwell and Moore a
   license to his patent and some future patents in the field.^[48][2]
   Just as this decision was being made, however, Dresser Industries
   bought Manning, Maxwell and Moore and didn't see the need for its
   aircraft division and its industrial robot patent licenses.

   This development prompted Engelberger to seek a backer to buy out the
   aircraft division and found one in Consolidated Diesel Electronic
   (Condec), which agreed to put up the financing for the continued
   development of the robot. This new Condec division was called Unimation
   Incorporated with Joseph Engelberger as its president.^[49][4]

   In 1961, Devol personally sold the first [50]Unimate robot which was
   shipped from Danbury, Connecticut to General Motors.^[51][5] GM first
   used the machine for die casting handling and spot welding.^[52][6] The
   first Unimate robot was installed at GM's plant in [53]Trenton, New
   Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die-casting machine and stack
   them. Soon companies such as Chrysler, Ford, and Fiat saw the necessity
   for large Unimate purchases.
   The first Unimate

   Approximately five million dollars was spent to develop the first
   Unimate. In 1966, after many years of market surveys and field tests,
   full scale production began in Connecticut. Unimation's first robot was
   a materials handling robot and was soon followed by robots for welding
   and other applications.

   In 1975, Unimation showed its first profit. In 1978, the PUMA
   (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) robot was developed by
   Unimation from Vicarm (Victor Scheinman) and with support from General
   Motors.

[[54]edit] Additional work

   Devol later obtained patents on visual and tactile sensors for robots,
   coaxial connectors, non-refillable containers, and magnetostrictive
   manipulators or "microrobotics", a field he created.
