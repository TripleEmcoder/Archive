   Dr. David Allais (born March 5, 1933) is an internationally recognized
   [15]expert and [16]inventor in the fields of [17]bar coding and
   [18]automatic identification and data capture.^[19][1] As vice
   president and later president and [20]chief executive officer of
   [21]Everett, Washington-based [22]Intermec Inc. (NYSE:IN),^[23][2] he

[[42]edit] Education and Accolades

   Allais received a [43]bachelor of science degree in mechanical
   engineering in [44]1954. He received a [45]master of science degree in
   mechanical engineering from the [46]University of Arizona in [47]1958
   and a master of science degree in [48]electrical engineering from
   [49]Stanford University in [50]1962. In [51]1965, Allais received a
   [52]doctor of philosophy degree from Stanford University. In 1988,
   Allais was awarded the Association for Automatic Identification and
   Mobility (AIM) Richard R. Dilling Award as a preeminent contributor to
   bar code technology^[53][4] and on October 16, 2009, Allais received
   the University of Arizona College of Engineering Lifetime Achievement
   Award.^[54][5]

[[55]edit] Inventions and Patents

   Allais is credited with creating five bar code symbologies: [56]Code
   39, [57]Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF), [58]Code 11, [59]Code 93 and Code 49.
   He is also named inventor on the following seven U.S. patents:
     * Patent # 3,001,369, Hydraulic System for Driving Several Actuators,
       1962, Assigned to IBM.^[60][6]
     * Patent # 3,067,333, Motion Control Apparatus, Assigned to
       IBM.^[61][7]
     * Patent # 3,670,145, Tape Feed System, 1972, Assigned to Intermec
       Corporation.^[62][8]
     * Patent # 3,784,794, Electro-Optical Reader for Bar Codes, 1974,
       Assigned to National Bank Of Commerce of Seattle.^[63][9]
     * Patent # 3,844,210, Multi-Color (bar code) Printer, 1974, Assigned
       to Intermec Corporation.^[64][10]
     * Patent # 3,909,594, Circuit for Establishing a Reference Voltage in
       Bar Code Readers, 1975, Assigned to Intermec Corporation.^[65][11]
     * Patent # 4,794,239, Multi-Track Bar Code (Code 49), 1988, Assigned
       to Intermec Corporation.^[66][12]

[[67]edit] Interleaved 2 of 5

   Allais developed Interleaved 2 of 5 in 1972 while at Intermec. It is a
   numeric only barcode used to encode pairs of numbers into a
   self-checking, high-density barcode format. The first digit is encoded
   in the five bars (or black lines), while the second digit is encoded in
   the five spaces (or white lines) [68]interleaved with them. Two out of
   every five bars or spaces are wide (therefore 2 of 5). Applications
   include labeling [69]corrugated [70]shipping containers and identifying
   [71]casino tickets.

[[72]edit] Code 39

   In 1974, Allais and Ray Stevens, both at Intermec at the time,
   developed Code 39.^[73][13] Code 39 is a barcode symbology that can
   encode uppercase letters (A through Z), digits (0 through 9) and a
   handful of special characters like the $ sign. Code 39 is broadly used
   particularly in the [74]automobile industry and [75]manufacturing.

[[76]edit] Code 11

   Code 11 is a barcode symbology developed by Allais while at Intermec in
   1977. It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode
   any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character
   (-).

[[77]edit] Code 93

   Code 93 is a barcode symbology developed by Allais in 1982 while at
   Intermec to provide a higher density and data security enhancement to
   Code 39. It is an alphanumeric, variable length symbology. Code 93 is
   designed to encode 26 upper case letters, 10 digits and 7 special
   characters:

          A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U,
          V, W, X, Y, Z
          0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
          -, ., $, /, +, %, SPACE.

[[78]edit] Code 49

   In 1987 Allais, while at Intermec, developed Code 49 as the next
   evolution in bar code symbology to solve scanning large amounts of data
   on small objects. Although the practical uses of Code 49 would be
   limited, it set the stage for the later development of [79]PDF417, a
   stacked linear bar code symbol that is widely used.

[[80]edit] Corporate Life

   After receiving his master of science degree in mechanical engineering
   from the University of Arizona in 1958, Allais went on to serve in
   various engineering and engineering management positions at IBM in both
   [81]California and [82]New York state from [83]1958 to [84]1968.

   In 1968, Allais was hired as the vice president of engineering by then
   Interface Mechanisms, now Intermec. From 1968 to 1988, he served in a
   number of executive management roles at Intermec as executive vice
   president, president & chief executive officer, chairman & chief
   executive officer, and chief scientist. 14 of those years at Intermec
   were spent as chief executive officer.

   In 1989, Allais founded PathGuide Technologies and served as its
   president until 2006. PathGuide, formerly Applied Tactical Systems of
   Washington, develops, markets, and implements real time warehouse
   management systems and time and attendance systems. PathGuide’s
   warehouse management systems make extensive use of bar code scanning
   and RF data communications. Allais currently serves as chairman of
   PathGuide.
