   marketing company [26]Ronco. He is well known for his appearances in

[[34]edit] Personal life and career

   Popeil learned his trade from his father, Samuel, who was also an
   inventor and [35]carny salesman of kitchen-related [36]gadgets such as
   the [37]Chop-O-Matic and the [38]Veg-O-Matic. The Chop-O-Matic retailed
   for [39]US$3.98 and sold over two million units. The [40]invention of
   the Chop-O-Matic caused a problem that marked the entrance of Ron
   Popeil into television. It turned out that the Chop-O-Matic was so
   efficient at chopping vegetables, that it was impractical for salesmen
   to carry the vegetables they needed to chop. The solution was to tape
   the demonstration. Once the demonstration was taped, it was a short
   step to [41]broadcasting the demonstration as a [42]commercial.

   Popeil received the [43]Ig Nobel Prize in Consumer Engineering in 1993.
   The awards committee described him as the "incessant [44]inventor and
   perpetual pitchman of [45]late night television"^[46][2] and awarded
   the prize in recognition of his "redefining the industrial revolution"
   with his devices.

   In August 2005, he sold his company, Ronco, to [47]Fi-Tek VII, a Denver
   [48]holding company, for US$55 million. He said he plans to continue
   serving as the [49]spokesman and [50]inventor, but wants to spend more
   time with his family. As of 2006, he lives in [51]Beverly Hills,
   California, with his wife, [52]Robin Popeil and two of his five
   daughters. [53]Ashley Tisdale is his cousin.^[54][3]

   Although Popeil often receives credit for having been the first to use
   this phrase, "But wait, there's more," its origin is attributed to the
   State Fair JAM Auctioneers. The JAM Auctioneers also were the first to
   use the phrase, "How much would you pay?" [55]Ed Valenti, founder and
   seller of the Ginsu knife added the word, "Now" to that phrase in the
   1970s. Like the JAM Auctioneers of past, each time that question was
   asked, another item would be added to the sale, thus enhancing the
   audience's and potential buyers' perceived value of the
   purchase.^[[56]citation needed]

[[57]edit] Inventions

   Some of his better-known products, and their original sale pitches,
   include:
     * Chop-O-Matic hand food processor. "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going
       to show you the greatest kitchen appliance ever made ... All your
       onions chopped to perfection without shedding a single tear."
     * Dial-O-Matic, successor to the Veg-O-Matic. "Slice a tomato so thin
       it only has one side."
     * Popeil Pocket Fisherman. "The biggest fishing invention since the
       hook ... and still only $19.95!" (According to the program
       [58]Biography, the original product was the invention of Popeil's
       father and only marketed by Ronco, but as of 2006, Popeil had
       introduced a redesigned version of the product.)^[59][4]
     * Mr. Microphone: a short-range hand-held radio transmitter that
       broadcast over FM radios. A convertible rolls up to a curb and an
       enthusiastic young man shouts out "Hey, good looking, I'll be back
       to pick you up later!" followed by the pitch "Broadcast your voice
       on any FM radio!!!"
     * Inside-The-Shell Egg Scrambler. "Gets rid of those slimy egg whites
       in your scrambled eggs." Popeil has said the inspiration for this
       product was his lifelong revulsion toward incompletely blended
       scrambled eggs.^[60][4]
     * Six Star 20-Piece Cutlery Set
     * Showtime Rotisserie, a small [61]rotisserie oven designed for
       cooking smaller sized portions of meat such as whole [62]chicken
       and [63]lamb. "Set it, and forget it!"
     * Solid Flavor Injector. This product accompanied the Showtime
       Rotisserie and was used to inject solid ingredients into meat or
       other foods. A similar product, called the [64]Liquid Flavor
       Injector, allowed for the injecting of liquid ingredients into
       meat, e.g., lime juice into chicken.
     * GLH-9 Hair in a Can Spray (Great Looking Hair Formula #9)
     * Drain Buster
     * Smokeless Ashtray: "Does cigar and cigarette smoke irritate your
       eyes?" Commercials showed this device drawing smoke from burning
       cigarettes back into the ashtray itself.
     * Electric Food Dehydrator: "Instead of giving kids candy, give them
       apple snacks or banana chips. And it's great if you're a hunter,
       fisherman, backpacker, or camper. Makes beef jerky for around $3 a
       pound, and you know what went in it, because you made it yourself!"
     * Ronco Popeil Automatic Pasta Maker
     * The Cap Snaffler: "Snaffles caps off any size jug, bottle, or
       jar ... and it really, really works."
     * The Showtime Six Star Plus 25 Knife Set and the Solid Flavor
       Injector: "Three easy payments of $13.33!"

[[65]edit] Popular culture

   This "[66]In popular culture" section may contain minor or trivial
   references. Please [67]reorganize this content to explain the subject's
   impact on popular culture rather than simply listing appearances, and
   remove trivial references. (November 2010)

   Ron Popeil's success in infomercials and his longevity and ubiquity on
   American television have caused him and his products to appear in a
   variety of mixed-media environments including cameo appearances on
   television shows such as the [68]X-Files,^[69][5]
   [70]Futurama^[71][6]^[72][7] [73]King of the Hill,^[74][8]^[75][9]
   [76]The Simpsons,^[77][10] [78]Sex and the City^[79][11] and [80]The
   Daily Show.^[81][12] Parodies of Popeil's infomercials were done on the
   comedy show [82]Saturday Night Live by [83]Dan Aykroyd^[84][13] and
   [85]Eddie Murphy^[86][14] and the "Veg-O-Matic" provided the
   inspiration for the "Sledge-O-Matic" routine used by comedian
   [87]Gallagher since the 1980s.^[[88]citation needed] Additionally, the
   [89]professional wrestling [90]tag team [91]The Midnight Express dubbed
   their Finishing Move the [92]Veg-O-Matic. The name was used because the
   move "sliced and diced" their opponents. Also, in the cartoon series
   "Transformers: Animated" the character Swindle has mannerisms that are
   based on Ron Popeil. In fact, in "Everything Must Go", Swindle even
   uses Ron's signature catch-phrase "Now, how much would you pay?", and
   in "Decepticon Air" he uses Ron's other catchphrase, "But wait, there's
   more!"

   In popular music, Popeil and his products have been an inspiration for
   lyrics in works by [93]Alice Cooper,^[94][15] The [95]Beastie
   Boys^[96][16] and [97]"Weird Al" Yankovic.^[98][17] One of Weird Al's
   background vocalists was Lisa Popeil, sister of Ron Popeil.^[99][18]
   Lisa Popeil also appears on a Frank Zappa album where she makes fun of
   Ronco and its products.^[100][19] In film, Ron Popeil's commercials
   have been used as clips in movies such as [101]Old School,^[102][20]
   [103]Elizabethtown^[104][21] and [105]The Kingdom^[106][22] In
   [107]Malcolm Gladwell's book [108]What the Dog Saw: And Other
   Adventures, Ron Popeil is interviewed and many of his products, most
   notably the Veg-O-Matic and Showtime Rotisserie, are discussed. The
   article was first published in The New Yorker in 2000.^[109][23] The
   [110]Modern Lovers recorded a song about a derelict automobile, "Dodge
   Veg-O-Matic."
