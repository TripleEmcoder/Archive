   Dr. William Edward "Butch" Hanford (December 9, 1908 – January 27,
   1996) was an [19]American chemist who is best known for developing the
   modern process to make multipurpose material polyurethane. Hanford’s
   most notable discovery occurred while working with fellow chemist
   [20]Dr. Donald Fletcher Holmes at DuPont. On June 2, 1942, Hanford was
   awarded a patent for his process. Currently, this method is responsible
   for manufacturing many of the plastics that are used in medicine, the
   automotive industry, and consumer products. Hanford’s later
   accomplishments included the development of the first liquid household
   detergent and a new kind of ammunition for Winchester-Western Company.
   For his work, Hanford was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of
   Fame in 1991. The New York Times has noted that Hanford’s developments
   were "monumental."

[[33]edit] Early life

   William Edward Hanford was born on December 9, 1908 in Bristol,
   Pennsylvania. His mother was Irene Laing Hanford, and she was born into
   considerable wealth. Although she came from an affluent family, Irene
   stayed at home and was responsible for her children’s upbringing.
   Hanford’s father was Thomas Cook Hanford. Thomas was originally from
   Philadelphia but he later moved to Bristol where he met his wife.
   Before marrying Irene, Thomas worked as a bookkeeper for a living. As a
   young man, Thomas injured himself while lifting heavy objects which
   prevented him from becoming a traditional laborer. Thomas married Irene
   in Bristol, Pennsylvania where the couple purchased a house and raised
   their family.

   William Edward Hanford was the second of three children. He was two
   years older than his youngest brother and two years younger than his
   oldest brother. During his childhood, Hanford’s mother stressed the
   importance of religion and taught Hanford the value of hard work.
   Although his mother was raised with considerable wealth, Hanford
   himself had little money as a child. Having lived through WWI, he
   learned to make the most of his opportunities and take his education
   seriously.

[[34]edit] Education

   Throughout his early education, Hanford focused primarily on his school
   work and sought to learn more about the scientific world around him. He
   graduated from Bristol High School in 1926. While attending high
   school, Hanford became interested in chemistry from his science
   teachers. Hanford’s uncle was a pharmacist and also encouraged his
   nephew’s interest in the subject.

   Following his graduation, Hanford decided that he wanted to earn a
   college degree in chemistry, but he was unsure of which institution he
   should attend. Because Hanford’s uncle was a pharmacist who had already
   graduated from the school, he suggested that his nephew should attend
   the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. At the time, the
   Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science had just opened a new
   chemistry division. This further sparked Hanford’s interest in the
   school. Hanford’s uncle agreed to pay for Hanford’s tuition, so he
   enrolled in the school in 1926. His class had a total of seven
   students, and each student had some prior connection to the field of
   pharmacy. In 1930, Hanford graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree
   and took a job at Rohm and Haas with the help of his uncle.

   After working for approximately eight months, Hanford left Rohm and
   Haas to go to graduate school. He had difficulty deciding between the
   Pennsylvania State University and the University of Illinois for his
   graduate studies, but he eventually enrolled at the University of
   Illinois. While at graduate school, he was mentored by Dr. Roger Adams.
   Hanford and Adams would remain lifelong friends after Hanford finished
   his graduate studies, and Adams would often advise Hanford about his
   career opportunities. While attending the University of Illinois,
   Hanford also met other notable chemists including Carl Marvel, Reynold
   Fuson, and Ralph Shriner. Similarly, he met his future colleague Donald
   Holmes who was also attending the university. In 1935, Hanford
   graduated with his Ph.D. in organic chemistry.

[[35]edit] Career

   Soon after graduating from the University of Illinois, Hanford sought
   employment. He decided to turn down an offer to return to Rohm and Haas
   in favor of working for DuPont. It was Hanford’s friend and future
   colleague Donald Holmes who got Hanford the job. Roger Adams told
   Hanford that he should work in the company’s experimentation division.
   Once at DuPont, Hanford began to develop the processes that would win
   him numerous awards and allow him to hold over 120 patents.

   In 1935, Hanford officially started working for DuPont. While working
   at the company, Hanford was given the freedom to explore the areas of
   research that interested him. He started to work with thiocyanates.
   These compounds were the main components in insecticides and
   lubricants. After approximately six months, Hanford was made a group
   leader and given two assistants. It was at this time that Hanford began
   to work on problems that other chemists could not solve. The first
   challenge Hanford faced was the need to polymerize caprolactam. He
   inherited the problem from famed chemist Wallace Carothers who was also
   working at DuPont at the time. Within a week, Hanford and his two
   assistants had found a solution that yielded ninety-six percent of
   Carothers’ desired polymer. Solving this problem furthered Hanford’s
   interest in polyamides and polyesters. He soon began to work with
   di-isocyanates by studying reactions that contained hydroxyl, carboxyl,
   amide, and amine components.

   On May 24, 1939, Hanford and Donald Holmes filed a patent titled
   “Process for Making Polymeric Products and for Modifying Polymeric
   Products.” This patent was the development that would eventually land
   Hanford in the Inventors Hall of Fame. After working at DuPont for
   three years, Hanford had devised a way to make polyurethane chains. His
   original inspiration came from a problem that fellow DuPont chemist
   Julian Werner Hill could not solve. Hill was trying to combine a number
   of polypols together, but he could not find a method to join them. Hill
   gave the challenge to Donald Holmes, but Holmes also could not solve
   the problem. While having lunch one day, Hanford asked Holmes how
   things were going. Holmes explained that he was getting nowhere, so
   Hanford suggested that Holmes should try using the di-isocyanates that
   Hanford had developed earlier. Following the meeting, Holmes took
   Hanford’s advice and together they developed the modern process for
   making multipurpose material polyurethane. Hanford’s understanding that
   polypols could be linked together with di-isocyanates allowed the two
   scientists to create their process. Three years after filing their
   original request, Hanford and Holmes were issued a patent for their
   process on June 2, 1942. The patent was assigned to DuPont.

   Later in 1942, Hanford left DuPont and took a job at General Aniline
   and Film Corporation (GAF). At age thirty-four, Hanford was made the
   director of research for the entire company. While at GAF, Hanford
   worked to produce the first commercial liquid laundry detergent. In
   addition to working on the actual formula for the detergent, Hanford
   also designed a better plastic bottle to hold the new product. The new
   detergent was marketed under the name “Glim” and had moderate
   commercial success.

   After working at GAF for four years, Hanford left the corporation to
   work for M. W. Kellogg Company in 1946. He considered M. W. Kellogg
   Company the “finest chemical engineering and petroleum company in the
   world,”6 and was soon made the director of petroleum and chemical
   research. In 1950, Hanford was named to the company’s board of
   directors and was promoted to the vice president position. He was also
   made the director of research for the entire company. Hanford’s
   research at the firm led to the discovery of a process that would lower
   the cost of ammonia production. He also worked on one of the first
   synthetic fuel projects by conducting research to derive gasoline from
   carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and coal.

   After working at M. W. Kellogg Company for seven years, Hanford left
   the firm to explore other projects. In 1957, Hanford had the
   opportunity to work for either 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
   Company) or Olin Corporation. Before making his decision, John Olin
   told Hanford, “You’ll be vice president of research... You’ll be in
   charge of all research in the entire corporation. That’s what you’re
   here for.”6 Hanford decided to work for Olin Corporation shortly after
   hearing this proposition. He soon got to work on a new kind of
   ammunition for Olin Corporation’s subsidiary, Winchester-Western
   Company. Hanford developed a plastic shotgun shell that was popular
   throughout the 1960s. The development utilized Hanford’s polyurethane
   process to strengthen the shell while cutting production costs. He
   later briefly experimented with different types of fuels for
   automobiles.

   In 1973, Hanford retired from Olin Corporation to become a consultant
   for his son’s company, World Water Resources Incorporated. Hanford’s
   retirement from Olin Corporation marked the end of his career as a
   corporate chemist.

[[36]edit] Inventions

   Hanford’s most notable development was his process for making material
   polyurethane. Although Hanford held over 120 patents before his death,
   these following two developments are some of his most notable
   achievements.

[[37]edit] Process for Multipurpose Material Polyurethane

   Hanford’s process was revolutionary because he discovered that
   di-isocyanates and existing polypols would join together into compounds
   very quickly. This discovery allowed polyurethane chains to be produced
   in greater numbers and at a lower cost than previously possible.
   Earlier German methods of polyurethane production needed time to cure
   and were not always dependable. Hanford’s process was simple, reliable,
   and able to produce polyurethane chains on an industrial scale. After
   making his discovery, Hanford was quoted as saying, “That invention
   took me seventeen minutes [to develop].”6 Similarly, the components
   needed to run Hanford’s process were not difficult or expensive to
   obtain. Although he never worked on the mass production of polyurethane
   himself, Hanford’s process was instrumental in creating the modern
   polyurethane manufacturing industry. His process is still used today
   for the production of most forms of polyurethane plastic and foam.

   Currently, polyurethane is utilized extensively as a foam or varnish.
   Seats, dashboard instrument panels, headliners, and bumpers are common
   uses for polyurethane in automobiles. The solid wheels used on
   rollerblades, skateboards, and shopping carts are often entirely made
   of polyurethane. Modern medicine uses polyurethane for artificial heart
   valves and as a transparent varnish for many prosthetic devices. The
   construction industry uses polyurethane for insulation, molding, and
   other residential fixtures. Other identifiable uses for polyurethane
   include Wilson tennis grips, Seiko watch-bands, Gorilla Glue, and Excel
   Adhesive. It is unlikely that many of these products would have been
   manufactured on an industrial scale without Hanford’s original process.

[[38]edit] Mark 5 shotgun shell

   In the early 1960s, Hanford developed the Mark 5 shotgun shell while
   working for Olin Corporation. At the time, he was researching for the
   Winchester-Western division of the company. Hanford incorporated the
   properties from his past developments into his new design. He was able
   to make a very thin plastic shell casing that reduced the weight of the
   ammunition and cut production costs. The new shell casing was formed
   almost entirely from plastic and had an additional polyurethane collar.
   The polyurethane collar kept the inside of the shotgun barrel cleaner
   than previous types of ammunition after prolonged firing. The collar
   also lessened the dispersion of the pellets when they left the barrel,
   thereby making the ammunition more effective for game hunting or sport
   shooting. Most importantly, the Mark 5 shotgun shell delivered greater
   force than competing types of ammunition without increasing a weapon’s
   recoil strength. In March 1962, Winchester-Western Company began to
   sell the new ammunition to the public. Hanford’s shell was highly
   popular because of its light weight and superior performance.
   Winchester-Western Company produced the Mark 5 shell in 12-gauge,
   16-gauge, and 20-gauge sizes.

[[39]edit] Nickname

   William Edward Hanford has often been referred to as “Butch” Hanford
   because of his appearance when working in the laboratory. While at the
   University of Illinois, Hanford often wore a dirty laboratory coat that
   was covered in chemicals. He would also cut the sleeves off of his coat
   to allow him to work more easily. His colleagues jokingly said that the
   only name that could characterize his appearance would be “Butch”
   because he resembled a butcher. After graduating from the University of
   Illinois, the nickname followed Hanford for the rest of his career.

[[40]edit] Later life and legacy

   William Edward Hanford married his wife Lorraine as a young man.
   Together they had a son, William Edward Hanford Jr., who is currently a
   lawyer and owns World Water Resources Incorporated. The company seeks
   to provide water sterilization systems for developing countries.

   Despite the acclaim and importance of Hanford’s polyurethane production
   process, he received zero additional compensation for his patent from
   DuPont. Hanford received a salary from the firm, but the company
   provided him with no additional payment because he was a corporate
   chemist. Likewise, Hanford’s patent was assigned to DuPont so he could
   not sell the rights to his discovery. He once remarked that he was
   never compensated beyond his regular salary for any of his 120 patents
   from any corporation. Furthermore, Hanford did not receive royalties
   for his developments either.

   On January 27, 1996, William Edward Hanford died in Bethesda, Maryland.
   He was eighty-seven years old. Following his death, The New York Times
   published his obituary on January 31, 1996 and noted that his
   developments were “a tremendous breakthrough.”2 Hanford is survived by
   his wife, son, and two grandchildren.
