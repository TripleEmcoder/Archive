   Known for Wireless Telegraphy development ^[17][3]

   Mahlon Loomis (26 July 1826, [18]Oppenheim, New York - 13 October 1886,
   [19]Terra Alta, West Virginia) was an early [20]wireless telegraph
   [21]experimenter.

[[27]edit] Early history

   Loomis, a [28]Washington, DC dentist, claimed to have transmitted
   signals in October 1866 between two [29]Blue Ridge Mountain-tops 14
   miles apart in [30]Virginia, using [31]kites as [32]antennas, but with
   no independent witnesses present.^[33][4]

[[34]edit] Patent

   Loomis received [35]U.S. Patent 129,971 for a [36]wireless
   [37]telegraph in 1872.^[38][5] This one-page patent makes a vague claim
   about using [39]atmospheric electricity to eliminate the overhead wire
   used by the existing telegraph systems, but it contains no
   [40]schematic diagram of how to build it, and no theory of how it might
   function. Loomis envisioned towers "on the tops of high mountains, and
   thus penetrate or establish electrical connection with the atmospheric
   stratum ... to form the electrical circuit."

   Loomis's patent is substantially similar to [41]U.S. Patent 126,356
   received three months earlier by [42]William Henry Ward who applied for
   the patent on June 29, 1871 when Loomis was actively promoting his idea
   of using atmospheric electricity for telegraph communication. Ward's
   patent also contains no schematic diagram. Instead, Ward illustrates
   and describes towers that rotate into the wind "to drive an aerial
   current of electricity into the insulated middle portion of the tower,
   which current passes upwardly through the upper portion of the tower
   and out through the ventilator or the top... whereby the tower is
   receiving continually fresh and new supplies of electricity".

   The two patents in some places use almost identical language:

          "I also dispense with all artificial batteries, but use the free
          electricity of the atmosphere, co-operating with that of the
          earth... for telegraphing and for other purposes, such as light,
          heat, and motive power." (Loomis)
          "I entirely dispense with artificial batteries, forming my
          circuit merely by connecting the aerial current with the earth
          current... for the use of land lines of telegraphs or for other
          purposes, such as light, heat, &c." (Ward)

   In January 1873, the [43]United States Congress declined to charter the
   Loomis Aerial Telegraph Co. One [44]congressman, pleading Loomis' case
   in the House, said, "He entertains a dream, and it may be only a dream,
   a wild dream that when his proposition comes to be fully applied, it
   may light and warm your houses...." Loomis, himself, addressed Congress
   at one point, stating that his proposal functioned by "Causing
   electrical vibrations or waves to pass around the world, as upon the
   surface of some quiet lake one wave circlet follows another from the
   point of the disturbance to the remotest shores, so that from any other
   mountain top upon the globe another conductor, which shall pierce this
   plane and receive the impressed vibration, may be connected to an
   indicator which will mark the length and duration of the vibration; and
   indicate by any agreed system of notation, convertible into human
   language, the message of the operator at the point of the first
   disturbance." ^[45][2]

[[46]edit] Analysis

   Loomis noted that transmission was possible only when the kites were
   flown to the same altitude above ground, which seemed to confirm his
   hypothesis that he was completing a DC circuit through layers of the
   atmosphere that he hypothesized carried such currents. We know now that
   there is no basis for such a system.

   One version of the Loomis apparatus used a keyed connection to ground
   at the transmitting station, and a spark gap to ground at the receiver.
   Radio frequency transients would have been generated by keying the
   sky-ground DC potential at the transmitter, and if the kite wires were
   of the same length (which would have the kites at the same altitude
   above terrain), the receiving apparatus would have been resonant and
   able to receive such a signal. This may account for his result—not by
   tapping into the same layer of atmosphere, but because the wires were
   the same length.
