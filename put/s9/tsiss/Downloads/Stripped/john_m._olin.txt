[[21]edit] Early life

   Born in [22]Alton, [23]Illinois, Olin graduated from [24]Cornell
   University with a B.Sc. degree in chemistry and as a brother of the
   [25]Kappa Sigma Fraternity. With major financial contributions to the
   [26]School of Business and the [27]Olin Library at [28]Washington
   University in [29]St. Louis, both buildings were named after him. In
   addition, [30]Olin Library at Cornell University bears his name, as
   does a classroom building, Olin Hall, at Johns Hopkins University
   [31][1].

   He married twice. By his first wife, the former Adele Levis, a
   granddaughter of the founder of [32]Illinois Glass Company, he had two
   daughters, Adele Louise and Georgene.

   With his second wife, Evelyn Brown, he had one stepdaughter, Evelyn.

[[33]edit] Business

   Olin started his career in 1913 as a chemical engineer for his father's
   [34]Western Cartridge Company, a predecessor of [35]Olin Industries,
   Inc. In 1935, following Western Cartridge's acquisition of the
   [36]Winchester Repeating Arms Company, he was named First
   Vice-President of the merged Winchester-Western and head of the
   Winchester division. He became President of Olin Industries in 1944 and
   upon merger of the company with [37]Mathieson Chemical Corporation in
   1954 became Chairman of the Board of the new corporation, named Olin
   Mathieson Chemical Corporation. Subsequently the name was shortened to
   Olin Corporation. Mr. Olin retired as Chairman of the Board in 1957 to
   become Chairman of the Executive Committee, a position he held until he
   was elected Honorary Chairman of the Board in 1963.

   Olin was an inventor or co-inventor of 24 United States patents in the
   field of arms and ammunition manufacture and design and was responsible
   for numerous developments in ballistics.

   John Merrill Olin died in 1982 at age 89 at his home in [38]East
   Hampton, New York.

[[39]edit] Thoroughbred horse racing

   [40]Wiki letter w cropped.svg This section requires [41]expansion.

   John and Evelyn Olin bred and raced a number of [42]Thoroughbred
   [43]racehorses, notably winning the 1963 [44]Epsom Oaks with the filly,
   [45]Noblesse, and the 1974 [46]Kentucky Derby with the colt,
   [47]Cannonade.

   His granddaughter, [48]Adele B. Dilschneider, is also a Thoroughbred
   owner and breeder whose memberships has included the [49]Kentucky Derby
   Museum, the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, the American
   Horse Council, the Thoroughbred Club of America, and the [50]National
   Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.
