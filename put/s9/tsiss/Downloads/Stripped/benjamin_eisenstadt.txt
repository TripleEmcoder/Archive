[[21]edit] Biography

   Born in [22]New York City, and educated at [23]Brooklyn College, he
   first operated a cafeteria across from the Navy Yard in [24]Brooklyn.
   He then switched to making tea bags after his cafeteria declined in
   revenue. He came up with the idea of single servings of table sugar to
   utilize his tea bag machinery. He shopped the idea to the major sugar
   producers, but since he didn't get a patent, they used his idea without
   paying him proper royalties. In 1957 he came up with a formula for a
   powdered [25]saccharin sweetener. Previously saccharin was sold as
   liquid drops, or tiny, hard-to-dissolve tablets. He mixed the saccharin
   with [26]dextrose to bulk it up to a teaspoon sized portion, added
   [27]cream of tartar, and [28]calcium silicate as an anti-caking agent.
   He marketed it in bright pink packets. His company was also the first
   to package [29]soy sauce and other single serving condiments. After his
   company was successful he became Chairman of the Board of Maimonides
   Research and Development Foundation in Brooklyn. He married Betty
   Gellman (1910-2001) on October 27, 1931 while living at 1250 44th
   Street in Brooklyn. They had the following children: Marvin Eisenstadt
   who married Barbara; Gladys Eisenstadt; Ira Eisenstadt who married
   Deirdre Howley, and Ellen Eisenstadt who married Herbert Cohen.
   ^[30][2]

[[31]edit] Death

   Benjamin died at age 89, of complications from [32]coronary bypass
   surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. His daughter,
   Ellen Eisenstadt, had suggested the bypass surgery and her mother never
   forgave her for the death of Benjamin. When Betty died in 2001 she had
   written Ellen and her children out of the will. ^[33][1]

[[34]edit] Legacy

   [35]Maimonides Medical Center has the Eisenstadt Administration
   Building and the Gellman Pavilion. The Gellman Pavilion was named in
   memory of Dr. Abraham Gellman, the brother of Betty Gellman
   (1910-2001).
