[[18]edit] Beginnings

   Erastus Bigelow was born in [19]West Boylston, Massachusetts. He was
   the son of a cotton weaver, and it was his parents' desire that he
   should become a [20]physician, but, his father's business not being
   successful, he was unable to continue his studies, and so turned his
   attention to inventing.^[21][1] He showed an inventive genius at the
   early age of 14, when he invented a machine to manufacture piping cord,
   for which he received $100. Before he had reached the age of 18, he had
   devised a handloom for suspender webbing. His work on Stenography, a
   short manual on [22]shorthand writing, was written and published about
   this time.^[23][1] In 1838, he invented a power loom for weaving
   knotted counterpanes, and later a power loom to weave coach lace and
   took his brother, Horatio, in with him.

[[24]edit] Carpets

   In 1839 he contracted to produce a power-loom capable of weaving
   two-ply ingrain carpets, such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by
   the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first
   loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he
   increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was
   regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving
   Brussels tapestry and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important
   invention, which attracted much attention at the [25]World's Fair in
   London in 1851. The town of [26]Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth
   and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace
   works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, all
   of which were direct results of his inventive ability.^[27][1] The
   carpet loom made his name widely known.^[28][2]

   Bigelow and his brother Horatio are credited with founding the town of
   Clinton, which was originally part of the town of [29]Lancaster.
   Bigelow was elected a member of the Boston Historical Society in April
   1864, and in 1869 presented to that society six large volumes entitled
   Inventions of Erastus Brigham Bigelow patented in England from 1837 to
   1868 in which were gathered the printed specifications of eighteen
   patents granted to him in England.^[30][1]

   In 1862 Bigelow formulated a scheme of uniform taxation for the United
   States by means of stamps, and he published The Tariff Question,
   considered in regard to the Policy of England and the Interests of the
   United States (Boston, 1863).^[31][1]

[[32]edit] Legacy

   Bigelow founded the Bigelow Mechanics Institute in 1846, which is today
   known as the Bigelow Free Public Library located in [33]Clinton,
   Massachusetts.^[34][3] He was also an original incorporator of the
   [35]Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded in 1861.
