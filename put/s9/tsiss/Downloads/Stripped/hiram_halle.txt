   Occupation  Businessman

   Hiram J. Halle (1867–1944) was an American businessman, inventor, and
   philanthropist. He was also part owner of [8]Gulf Oil company. Halle
   was dedicated to Jewish causes during [9]World War II.

   Born in [10]Cleveland, Ohio, he dropped out of high school to work in
   his family business—a dry goods store. Hiram Halle was a shy, homely
   man considered to be a workaholic. He ran his a personal WPA between
   1936 and 1939, bringing European Jewish exiles to Pound Ridge to work
   on refurbishing vintage houses in the area.

[[20]edit] Inventions

   Hiram Halle was the owner of numerous patents in many different
   industries.

   He invented a process for refining hydrocarbons in the production of
   marketable gasoline and hydrocarbon sulfonic acids, and an apparatus to
   distill oils. In addition he developed sophisticated typewriter parts,
   including specific ways for the typewriter to feed through continuous
   sheets of paper and detach the strip at a desired place, a card/sheet
   holder allowing the typewriter to print upon a flat surface, enhancing
   the typing quality of the machine, and a new type of platen to
   facilitate displacement, replacement, and adjustment of work. He also
   developed parts for typewriter machines specifically related to the
   printing of books that enabled the user to raise and lower the machine
   to make printing more convenient and time efficient.

   Hiram Halle also invented a new way to hang and secure clothing
   garments with a hook and eye, increasing the ease and safety of garment
   hanging. Continuing his inventive streak, Halle developed a new kind of
   multi-perforated bill statement sheet with many separating areas to
   tear off statements.

[[21]edit] New School

   Halle was an integral part of the creation of The University in
   Exile—an extension of the [22]New School for Social Research. Founded
   in 1933 by [23]Alvin Johnson, the University in Exile was dedicated to
   rescuing scholars who had lost their positions under [24]Hitler during
   that time. Johnson sought $120,000 to finance 15 scholars over a
   two-year period at salaries of $4,000 per year. Halle was "captivated"
   by Johnson's idea and pledged the entire sum, requesting that he remain
   anonymous.^[25][1] With the grant from Halle, Johnson actively
   recruited members of the German intellectual and activist community. In
   1934, the organization took the name Graduate Faculty of Political and
   Social Science. Other notable donations from refugee aid organizations
   included The [26]Rockefeller Foundation and the Emergency Committee in
   Aid of Displaced German Scholars.^[27][2]

   Between 1933 and 1945, the New School helped hundreds of European
   scholars and artists, including [28]Mario Einaudi, [29]Claude
   Lévi-Strauss, [30]Wilhelm Reich and [31]Gaetano Salvemini, in the
   social sciences and history, and [32]Herbert Berghof, [33]Fritz
   Eichenberg, [34]Erwin Piscator and [35]George Szell in the arts.

   There is a Hiram J. Halle Fellowship that is awarded annually at the
   New School. It is given to doctoral candidates who have demonstrated
   "outstanding merit" and are considered candidates of "special
   competence and originality" by New School faculty.^[36][3]

[[37]edit] Universal Oil Products

   More businessman than scientist, Halle nevertheless nurtured an
   atmosphere of respect for research in which top scientists thrived. In
   1914, [38]J. Ogden Armour hired him to manage the newly created
   [39]Universal Oil Products company, which had as its main asset the
   Dubbs patents for [40]cracking oil. Halle was elected president of UOP
   in 1919, the year C. P. Dubbs perfected a continuous-circulation
   process that proved superior to the original patent and to any other
   method of refining oil. Halle chose to license the Dubbs process to all
   refiners rather than enter the refining business in competition with
   them. This decision became the business formula under which UOP still
   operates. Halle remained in charge of UOP until his death in 1944 at
   age 76.^[41][4]

[[42]edit] Riverside

   The [43]Riverside research and development laboratory was conceived in
   1921 by Hiram J. Halle, the chief executive officer of Universal Oil
   Products (now simply UOP), as a focal point where the best and
   brightest scientists could create new products and provide scientific
   support for the oil refining industry. By 1921, that industry was
   growing rapidly as increasing numbers of automobiles led to greater
   demand for refined oil products. The establishment of Riverside gave
   independent oil refiners access to scientific research that allowed
   them to compete with the major oil companies. Halle also thought the
   laboratory would make a positive statement about the influence of his
   new organization.^[44][4]

[[45]edit] Pound Ridge

   Halle moved to [46]Pound Ridge, New York, part of wealthy
   [47]Westchester County, New York located about an hour outside of New
   York City. He arrived in 1928 at the age of 61 at a time when the
   farming community was in economic decline. Halle bought 33 homes over
   the next decade and worked on improving these homes, 13 of which are
   now on the National Register of Historic Places.^[48][5] He also
   purchased a former farm on Trinity Pass Road, moved some barns to the
   property, and used them to store his vast collection of English and
   American antiques. Halle created a workshop on his property where his
   team of 60 laborers worked, and also paid locals to rebuild the stone
   walls and perform other repairs in town. With unemployment rampant
   during [49]The Great Depression, Halle, the largest landowner, was also
   the largest employer in town.^[50][6] There is some controversy over
   whether his changes to these homes are considered restorations to
   reflect "colonial revivalism" or straight out renovations. Today, town
   historians say his changes were drastic and call his changes to these
   homes as "hallecized".

   Halle was also dedicated to the development of his adopted hometown,
   [51]Pound Ridge, New York. Between 1936-39 he brought Jewish exiles to
   Pound Ridge to restore classic homes.^[52][7] This work played a key
   role in revitalizing the town. His philanthropy also extended to the
   town's farmers left struggling through the Depression. His purchases of
   family homesteads afforded the families enough money to leave town or
   allow those who stayed to remain on Halle's payroll.

   Halle also boasted a private collection of historically important books
   and documents, including the original edition of Richard Carmarden's" A
   Caveat for the Quene"(1570). Additionally, Halle owned a now famous
   collection of Georgian furniture, paintings, works by Epstein, and many
   other important pieces of artwork.

   Well known actors and entertainers have flocked to [53]Pound Ridge, New
   York and made it their homes, because of its small town quality,
   privacy, and easy commute to Manhattan. Some famous residents, past and
   present, include: [54]Susan Sarandon, [55]Tim Robbins, [56]Christopher
   Reeve, [57]Eartha Kitt, [58]Ellen Barkin, [59]Benny Goodman,
   [60]Richard Gere, [61]Mike Myers, [62]Jessica Tandy, [63]Jane Pauley,
   and many others.

   The [64]Pound Ridge Historic District was added to the [65]National
   Register of Historic Places in 1985.^[66][8]

[[67]edit] Hiram Halle Memorial Library

   The library in Pound Ridge, located at 258 Hiram Halle Library, on
   Route #124 in Pound Ridge, New York, is named for him, the Hiram Halle
   Memorial Library. Its original building was an old schoolhouse sold to
   the town by the Halle Family Trust.

   The Hiram Halle Library opened in 1952 and today has a collection of
   over 60,000 items including books, magazines, CDs, talking- book
   cassettes and videos. The Library's collection is particularly strong
   in the arts, biographies, mysteries and cookbooks. In addition, the
   Library offers an electronic database and Internet access for reference
   and research. Through the Interlibrary Loan Program, books not owned by
   the Library can be provided quickly and efficiently via Westlynx, the
   computerized card catalog of Westchester's 38 public libraries and
   other data bases. The Library also offers activities such as The Adult
   Learning Center, arts and craft exhibits, films, concerts, lectures and
   book-discussion programs year round. The Library also sponsors a wide
   range of children's activities including Winter and Spring vacation
   programs, story hours, holiday activities, arts and crafts workshops,
   and the annual Summer Reading Program.

   The Pound Ridge Library Foundation announced the launching of a $2.9
   million Capital Campaign that would serve to expanding and repairing
   the old library. The campaign is estimated to take up to five years and
   will use tax deductible contributions.^[68][9]
