   Max Fleischer (July 19, 1883 – September 11, 1972) was an American
   animator. He was a pioneer in the development of the [19]animated
   cartoon and served as the head of [20]Fleischer Studios. He brought
   such animated characters as [21]Betty Boop, [22]Koko the Clown,
   [23]Popeye, and [24]Superman to the movie screen and was responsible
   for a number of technological innovations.

[[33]edit] Early life

   Born to a [34]Jewish family in [35]Kraków, [36]Poland, then part of the
   [37]Austrian-Hungarian province of [38]Galicia, Max Fleischer was the
   second oldest of six children of an Austrian immigrant tailor, William
   Fleischer.^[39][1] His family emigrated to the [40]USA in 1887 and
   settled in [41]New York City, where he attended public school; he spent
   his formative years in Brownsville and Brooklyn. He attended Evening
   High School, received commercial art training at [42]Cooper Union, and
   also attended The Mechanics and Tradesman's School. While still in his
   teens, he worked for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle as an errand boy, and
   eventually became a cartoonist. It was during this period he met
   newspaper cartoonist and early animator, [43]John Randolph Bray. He
   married his childhood sweetheart, Ethel (Essie) Gold on December 25,
   1905. Shortly afterward he accepted an illustrator's job for a catalog
   company in Boston. He returned to New York as Art Editor for
   [44]Popular Science magazine around 1912; he also wrote books,
   including one called Noah's Shoes.

[[45]edit] The Rotoscope

   Fleischer devised a concept to simplify the process of animating
   movement by tracing frames of live action film. His patent for the
   [46]Rotoscope was granted in 1915, although Max and his brother
   [47]Dave Fleischer made their first cartoon using the system in 1914.
   Extensive use of this technique was made in Fleischer's [48]Out of the
   Inkwell series for the first five years of the series, which started in
   1919 and starred [49]Koko the Clown and Fitz the dog.

[[50]edit] Fleischer Studios

   Fleischer produced his Inkwell films for the [51]Bray Studios until
   1921, when he and brother Dave established [52]Fleischer Studios
   (initially named "Out of the Inkwell Films") to produce animated
   cartoons and short subjects; Max was credited as the producer at the
   beginning of every cartoon as well. Koko and Fitz remained the stars of
   the Out of the Inkwell series, which was renamed Inkwell Imps in 1927.
   The Fleischer brothers also partnered with [53]Lee DeForest, Edwin
   Miles Fadiman, and [54]Hugo Riesenfeld to form Red Seal Pictures
   Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as
   far west as [55]Cleveland, Ohio.

   Fleischer invented the "[56]follow the bouncing ball" technique for his
   [57]Song Car-Tunes series of animated singalong shorts beginning in May
   1924. After a few films with unsynchronized sound (music and [58]sound
   effects only), Fleischer added synchronized sound to this series, with
   [59]My Old Kentucky Home (released April 13, 1926) with a dog-like
   character saying "Follow the ball, and join in, everybody." The sound
   entries in the Song Car-Tunes series — roughly 19 out of 36 short films
   — used the [60]Phonofilm [61]sound-on-film process developed by Lee
   DeForest. The Song Car-Tunes series would last until early 1927, just a
   few months before the actual start of the sound era. This was before
   [62]Walt Disney's [63]Steamboat Willie (1928), which is often
   mistakenly cited as the first cartoon to synchronize sound with
   animation. However, by late 1926, both the DeForest Phonofilm Corp. and
   Red Seal Pictures had filed for bankruptcy, and the Song Car-Tunes
   series came to an end.

   In 1923, Fleischer made two 20-minute educational features explaining
   [64]Albert Einstein's [65]Theory of Relativity ([66]The Einstein Theory
   of Relativity) and [67]Charles Darwin's [68]Theory of Evolution. Both
   features used a combination of animated special effects and live
   action. Fleischer also produced [69]Finding His Voice (1929)
   illustrating how [70]sound films worked.

   Into the early sound era, Fleischer produced many technically advanced
   and sophisticated animated films. Several of his cartoons had
   soundtracks featuring live or rotoscoped images of the leading [71]jazz
   performers of the time, most notably [72]Cab Calloway, [73]Louis
   Armstrong and [74]Don Redman. Fleischer's use of black performers was
   bold at a time when depictions of blacks were often denigrating and
   stereotypical.

[[75]edit] Finding success

   In 1928, as film studios made the transition to sound, Fleischer
   revived the Song Car-Tunes series as [76]Screen Songs, starting with
   the release of [77]The Sidewalks of New York on February 5, 1929
   through [78]Paramount Pictures. Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. was
   reorganized as [79]Fleischer Studios in January 1929 following
   bankruptcy. During this time, Walt Disney was also gaining success with
   [80]Mickey Mouse and [81]Silly Symphonies. In August 1929, the silent
   Inkwell Imps series was replaced with the [82]Talkartoon series,
   beginning with Noah's Lark. A year into the series, Fitz was renamed
   "[83]Bimbo" and became the star of the Talkartoon series, starting with
   the cartoon Hot Dog (1930).

   However, in August 1930, a Rubenesque poodle-human hybrid, Bimbo's
   girlfriend, made her screen debut in [84]Dizzy Dishes, and quickly
   became Fleischer's biggest star; she would later be named [85]Betty
   Boop. By 1931, Betty's floppy canine ears had evolved into [86]hoop
   earrings, and she was transformed into a fully human girl (though she
   retained her romantic relationship with the dog for several episodes
   after her transmogrification). By the time of [87]Minnie the Moocher
   (1932), Betty Boop was in a class of her own, and by August 1932,
   starting with [88]Stopping the Show, the Talkartoon series was renamed
   as Betty Boop Cartoons; by now, as noted from even the opening song
   from Stopping the Show, Betty clearly became the self-proclaimed "Queen
   of the Animated Screen." Along with his standout star Boop, Fleischer
   had become one of the two premier animation producers; the
   up-and-coming Walt Disney was the other.

   Fleischer cartoons were very different from Disney cartoons, in concept
   and in execution. The Fleischer approach was sophisticated, focused on
   surrealism, dark humor, adult psychological elements and sexuality. The
   Fleischer milieu was grittier, more urban, sometimes even sordid, often
   set in squalid tenement apartments with cracked, crumbling plaster and
   threadbare furnishings. Even the jazz music on Fleischer's soundtracks
   was rawer, saucier, more fitting with the unflinching Fleischer look at
   America's multicultural scene. But as popular as Betty Boop was for
   Fleischer, the Fleischer Studios would never come close to matching the
   huge international success of Mickey Mouse.

   Fleischer would come closest through his deal securing the rights to
   the [89]comic strip character [90]Popeye the Sailor from [91]King
   Features Syndicate. Popeye started out as a secondary character in 1929
   in the newspaper feature Thimble Theater, and made his film debut in
   July, 1933, introduced in the Betty Boop short Popeye the Sailor.
   Popeye was an immediate hit for Fleischer, and would remain in
   production until 1957.

   Fleischer's studio was a major operation in New York under the support
   of [92]Paramount Studio. But as a recipient of Paramount cash,
   Fleischer was also at the mercy of Paramount's management. During the
   [93]Great Depression, Paramount went through four name changes and
   reorganizations due to bankruptcies. These reorganizations affected the
   production budgets and created obstacles to Fleischer's development.

   When the three-color [94]Technicolor process became available,
   Paramount vetoed it based on their concerns with economic balance,
   giving Disney the opportunity to acquire an exclusivity to the process
   for four years, thus giving him the market edge on color cartoons. Two
   years later, Paramount approved color production for Fleischer, but he
   was left with the clearly inferior two-color processes of [95]Cinecolor
   (red and blue) and two-strip Technicolor (red and green). The [96]Color
   Classics series was introduced in 1934 as Fleischer's answer to
   Disney's Silly Symphonies.

   These color cartoons were augmented with a Fleischer-patented
   three-dimensional background effect called "The Stereoptical Process,"
   a precursor to Disney's Multiplane. This technique replaced the usual
   flat-plane, drawn and painted cartoon backgrounds with a circular 3-D
   scale-model background — a [97]diorama — in front of which the action
   cels were positioned and photographed. As the character, say, hustled
   down a city street, the camera operator would rotate the diorama a
   click with each frame. The result was a constantly changing perspective
   of converging parallel lines that gave an amazing sense of depth. The
   process worked most dramatically with pans or tracking shots; for
   static shots, traditional drawn backgrounds sufficed. It was used to
   great effect in the longer format Popeye cartoons [98]Popeye the Sailor
   Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936) and [99]Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali
   Baba's Forty Thieves (1937). These series of double-length (two-reel)
   cartoons were a gradual progression expressing Fleischer's desire to
   produce feature-length animated features. And while he had concepts for
   full-length features, it was not until the success of Disney's
   [100]Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) that the stodgy Paramount
   executives realized the value of an animated feature as Fleischer had
   been proposing for the previous three years.

[[101]edit] Animated features and decline

   The popularity of Betty Boop was irreparably damaged as a result of the
   enforcement of the [102]Hays Code in 1934. Her overt sexuality was
   downplayed, and her racy [103]flapper attire was replaced with longer
   skirts and a less revealing neckline. While the production of the
   cartoons had become more refined with more structured stories, the
   level of the content was more juvenile, largely influenced by
   Paramount's front office, which was changing the tone of their films to
   reflect a more family-oriented audience by producing films more of the
   nature of MGM. Betty became a spinster career girl and maiden aunt
   character, a judgmental "good citizen" instead of the carefree,
   funloving Jazz Baby she had once been. As a result, she lost much of
   her audience appeal, and the era and musical style that she represented
   had already faded away with the coming of the Swing Era.

   In 1937, film production at Fleischer's studio was affected by a five
   month strike, which kept his cartoons off theater screens through the
   rest of the year. The strikers represented by the Commercial Artists
   and Designers Union were not recognized by the IATSE, which represented
   the majority of the motion picture crafts. But after five months,
   [104]Paramount Pictures urged Fleischer to settle. Then in March 1938,
   Fleischer Studios moved from New York City to [105]Miami, Florida. The
   reasons were many. While it was reasoned that the relocation removed
   the studio from further union agitation, they were in need of
   additional space for the production of features. Coincidentally with
   the move, relations between brothers Dave and Max began deteriorating.
   A feud started simmering after Dave began an adulterous affair with his
   Miami secretary in 1938, and was followed by more personal and
   professional disputes.

   While at Paramount, Dave Fleischer was asked by the studio to put the
   popular comic book and radio hero [106]Superman into a cartoon series.
   Despite the high budgets that came from the series — triple the budget
   of typical Popeye one-reelers — [107]Superman became the most
   successful cartoons in the late period of the studio. Its
   ultra-realistic drawing, stylish Art Deco look and magnificently
   intricate scoring made the Superman pilot the highwater mark of the
   studio's sophisticated output.

   In the wake of Disney's inarguable triumph with Snow White and the
   Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Paramount top brass finally acquiesced to
   Fleischer's longstanding appeals to produce feature-length animated
   films — and now they wanted one for a Christmas 1939 release. In order
   to finance the new operation, Fleischer negotiated a loan with
   Paramount that in essence surrendered the studio's assets for the term
   of the loan, 10 years.

   While [108]Gulliver's Travels ([109]1939) did moderate box office, it
   did not make back all of its costs since the production ran nearly
   $500,000 overbudget due to the relocation, transportation of film for
   processing and back, and costs of training new workers. At the time, it
   was also reported that the escalated war in Europe just three months
   before cut off Paramount's foreign release potential; however, recent
   information indicates that the picture was released in Europe but the
   returns were not reported to Fleischer Studios' accounting department.
   At the same time, returns on Popeye cartoons were also not properly
   accounted. These factors contributed to the continued financial losses
   for Fleischer's studio. The final blow came with the ill-fated release
   of their second feature, [110]Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941) two days
   before the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

   On May 24, 1941, Paramount initiated takeover of Fleischer's studio.
   Max remained nominally in charge, but the long-simmering personal feud
   with his brother Dave further complicated the situation. Shortly after
   the release of Mr. Bug, a disgusted Dave left for California to take
   over as head of [111]Columbia's [112]Screen Gems animation unit in
   April 1942 — just one month prior to the renewal of Fleischer's
   contract. The move put Dave in breach of contract, for taking a
   position with a competitor while still contracted to Paramount. This
   breach, along with the substantial debt to Paramount, gave the bigger
   studio the right to take control of the smaller, forcing Max out.
   Paramount installed new management, among them Max's son-in-law,
   [113]Seymour Kneitel. On May 25, 1942, the studio was renamed
   [114]Famous Studios, and it moved back to New York within eight months.

   Despite the disappointing performance of the feature films, the
   Superman series continued to do well. Nine episodes were completed by
   Fleischer Studios, with the final eight made by Famous Studios after
   the reorganization. Today, the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons are
   considered the final triumph of this great pioneer and his innovative
   studio.

[[115]edit] Later career

   After leaving his studio, Fleischer was brought in as head of the
   Animation Department for the industrial film company, The [116]Jam
   Handy Organization. While there he supervised the technical and cartoon
   animation departments, producing training films for the Army and Navy
   and was also involved with research and development for the war effort.
   Following the war, he supervised the production of the animated
   adaptation of [117]Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ([118]1948),
   sponsored by [119]Montgomery Ward. Fleischer left Handy in 1954 and
   returned as Production Manager for [120]The Bray Studios in New York.

   Fleischer lost a lawsuit against Paramount in 1955 over the removal of
   his name from the credits of his films. While Fleischer had issues over
   the breach of contract, he had avoided suing to protect his son-in-law,
   Seymour Kneitel, who still had a position with Paramount's Famous
   Studios. The lawsuit was lost because the court decided that, though
   Fleischer's case had merit, the statute of limitations had expired. In
   1958, Fleischer revived Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. and partnered
   with his former animator, [121]Hal Seeger to produce 100 color [122]Out
   of the Inkwell (1960–1961) cartoons for television. Actor [123]Larry
   Storch performed the voices for Koko and supporting characters Kokonut
   and Mean Moe.

   Although the rift with his brother Dave was never resolved, Max
   eventually formed a friendship with his old rival Walt Disney, who
   welcomed Max to a reunion with former Fleischer animators who were by
   then employed by Disney.

   Fleischer, along with his wife Essie, moved to the [124]Motion Picture
   Country House in 1967. He died from [125]heart failure on September 11,
   1972, after a period of poor health. On the day of his death, Max
   Fleischer was cited as a great pioneer who invented an industry, and
   was named by [126]Time magazine as the "Dean of Animated
   Cartoons."^[[127]citation needed]
