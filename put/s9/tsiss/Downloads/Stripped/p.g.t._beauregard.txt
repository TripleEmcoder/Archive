   Other work Author, civil servant, politician, and inventor

   Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard (pronounced [37]/ˈbɔərɨɡɑrd/; May 28,
   1818 – February 20, 1893) was a [38]Louisiana-born American military
   officer, politician, inventor, writer, civil servant, and the first
   prominent [39]general of the [40]Confederate States Army during the
   [41]American Civil War. Today he is commonly referred to as P.G.T.
   Beauregard, but he rarely used his first name as an adult and signed
   correspondence as G.T. Beauregard.

   Beauregard was trained as a civil engineer at the [42]United States
   Military Academy and served with distinction as an engineer in the
   [43]Mexican-American War. Following a brief appointment at West Point
   in 1861, with the South's secession, he became the first Confederate
   [44]brigadier general. He commanded the defenses of [45]Charleston,
   South Carolina, at the start of the Civil War at [46]Fort Sumter on
   April 12, 1861. Three months later he was the victor at the [47]First
   Battle of Bull Run near [48]Manassas, Virginia.

   Beauregard commanded armies in the [49]Western Theater, including at
   the [50]Battle of Shiloh in [51]Tennessee, and the [52]Siege of Corinth
   in northern [53]Mississippi. He returned to Charleston and defended it
   from repeated naval and land attacks in 1863. His greatest achievement
   was saving the important industrial city of [54]Petersburg, Virginia,
   and thus also the Confederate capital of [55]Richmond, from assaults by
   overwhelmingly superior [56]Union Army forces in June 1864.

   However, his influence over Confederate strategy was marred by his poor
   professional relationships with [57]President [58]Jefferson Davis and
   other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his
   commander, General [59]Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis and the
   remaining cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston
   surrendered most of the remaining armies of the Confederacy, including
   Beauregard and his men, to Maj. Gen. [60]William T. Sherman. Following
   his military career, Beauregard served as a [61]railroad executive. He
   became one of the few wealthy Confederate veterans because of his role
   in promoting the [62]Louisiana Lottery.

[[80]edit] Early life and education

   Beauregard was born at the "Contreras" sugar-cane [81]plantation in
   [82]St. Bernard Parish, [83]Louisiana, about 20 miles (32 km) outside
   [84]New Orleans, to a French-Spanish [85]Creole family, the third child
   of Jacques Toutant-Beauregard and Hélène Judith de Reggio
   Toutant-Beauregard.^[86][1] He had three brothers and three sisters.
   Beauregard attended New Orleans private schools and then went to a
   "French school" in [87]New York City. It was during his four years in
   New York, beginning at age 12, that he first learned to speak English,
   as French was his first language.^[88][2]

   He trained at the [89]United States Military Academy at [90]West Point,
   New York. One of his instructors was [91]Robert Anderson, who would
   later become the commander of [92]Fort Sumter and surrender to
   Beauregard at the start of the Civil War. Upon enrolling at West Point,
   Beauregard dropped the hyphen from his surname and treated Toutant as a
   middle name, to fit in with his classmates. From that point on, he
   rarely used his first name, preferring "G. T. Beauregard."^[93][3] He
   graduated second in his class in 1838 and excelled both as an
   [94]artilleryman and [95]military engineer. His Army friends gave him
   many nicknames: "Little Creole", "Bory", "Little Frenchman", "Felix",
   and "Little [96]Napoleon".^[97][4]

[[98]edit] Career in U.S. Army

   During the [99]Mexican-American War, Beauregard served as an engineer
   under General [100]Winfield Scott. He was appointed [101]brevet
   [102]captain for the battles of [103]Contreras and [104]Churubusco and
   [105]major for [106]Chapultepec, where he was wounded in the shoulder
   and thigh. He was noted for his eloquent performance in a meeting with
   Scott in which he swayed the opinions of the general officers assembled
   to change their planned tactics for attacking the fortress of
   Chapultepec. He was one of the first officers to enter [107]Mexico
   City. Beauregard considered his contributions in dangerous
   reconnaissance missions and devising strategy for his superiors to be
   more significant than those of his engineer colleague, Captain
   [108]Robert E. Lee, so he was disappointed when Lee and other officers
   received more brevets than he did.^[109][5]

   Beauregard returned from Mexico in 1848. For the next 12 years, he was
   in charge of what the Engineer Department called "the Mississippi and
   Lake defenses in Louisiana." Despite this title, much of his
   engineering work was done elsewhere, repairing old forts and building
   new ones on the [110]Florida coast and in [111]Mobile, Alabama. He also
   improved the defenses of [112]Forts St. Philip and Jackson on the
   Mississippi River below New Orleans. He worked on a board of Army and
   Navy engineers to improve the navigation of the shipping channels at
   the mouth of the Mississippi. He created and patented an invention he
   called a "self-acting bar excavator" to be used by ships in crossing
   bars of sand and clay. While still in the Army, he actively campaigned
   for the election of [113]Franklin Pierce, the Democratic presidential
   candidate in [114]1852, and a former general in the Mexican War who had
   been impressed by Beauregard's performance at Mexico City. Pierce
   appointed Beauregard as superintending engineer of the New Orleans
   Federal [115]customs house, a huge granite building that had been built
   in 1848. As it was sinking unevenly in the moist soil of Louisiana,
   Beauregard had to develop a renovation program. He served in this
   position from 1853 to 1860 and was able to stabilize the structure
   successfully.^[116][6]

   During his service in New Orleans, Beauregard became dissatisfied with
   life as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer
   Department late in 1856 that he was going to join the [117]filibuster
   [118]William Walker, who had seized control of [119]Nicaragua; he had
   offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior
   officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced
   Beauregard to change his mind. He briefly entered politics as a reform
   candidate for [120]mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted
   by both the [121]Whig and [122]Democratic parties to challenge the
   [123]Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly
   defeated.^[124][7]

   Employing the political influence of his brother-in-law, [125]John
   Slidell, Beauregard obtained an appointment as [126]superintendent of
   the U.S. Military Academy on January 23, 1861. His orders were revoked
   and he relinquished the office after only five days when [127]Louisiana
   [128]seceded from the [129]Union. He protested to the War Department
   that they had cast "improper reflection upon [his] reputation or
   position in the Corps of Engineers" by forcing him out as a Southern
   officer before any hostilities began.^[130][8]

[[131]edit] Family

   In 1841, Beauregard married Marie Laure Villeré, the daughter of Jules
   Villeré, a sugar cane planter in [132]Plaquemines Parish and a member
   of one of the most prominent French [133]Creole families in southern
   Louisiana. Marie was a paternal granddaughter of [134]Jacques Villeré,
   the second [135]governor of Louisiana. The couple had three children:
   René, Henri, and Laure. Marie died in March 1850, while giving birth to
   Laure.^[136][9]

   Ten years later, the widower Beauregard married Caroline Deslonde, the
   daughter of André Deslonde, a sugar cane planter from [137]St. James
   Parish. Caroline was a sister-in-law of [138]John Slidell, a [139]U.S.
   senator from Louisiana and later a Confederate [140]diplomat. She died
   in New Orleans in March 1864, when it was under Union occupation. They
   had no children together.^[141][10]

[[142]edit] Civil War

[[143]edit] Charleston

   On first meeting, most people were struck by [Beauregard's] "foreign"
   appearance. His skin was smooth and olive-complexioned. His eyes,
   half-lidded, were dark, with a trace of Gallic melancholy about them.
   His hair was black (though by 1860 he maintained this hue with dye). He
   was strikingly handsome and enjoyed the attentions of women, but
   probably not excessively or illicitly. He sported a dark mustache and
   goatee, and he rather resembled [144]Napoleon III, then ruler of
   France—although he often saw himself in the mold of the more celebrated
   [145]Napoleon Bonaparte.

   Confederate General P. Gustave Toutant Beauregard

   Beauregard traveled by steamship from New York to New Orleans and
   immediately began giving military advice to the local authorities,
   which included further strengthening Forts St. Philip and Jackson,
   which guarded the Mississippi approaches to New Orleans. He hoped to be
   named commander of the state army, but was disappointed that the state
   legislature appointed [147]Braxton Bragg. Aware that Beauregard might
   resent him, Bragg offered the officer the rank of colonel. Instead
   Beauregard enrolled as a private in the "Orleans Guards", a battalion
   of French Creole aristocrats. At the same time, he communicated with
   Slidell and the newly chosen President Davis, angling for a senior
   position in the new Confederate States Army. Rumors that Beauregard
   would be placed in charge of the entire Army infuriated Bragg. Davis,
   concerned about the political situation regarding the Federal presence
   at Fort Sumter in [148]Charleston Harbor, selected Beauregard to take
   command of Charleston's defenses. Beauregard seemed the perfect
   combination of military engineer and charismatic Southern leader needed
   at that time and place.^[149][12]

   Beauregard became the first Confederate [150]general officer, appointed
   a [151]brigadier general in the Provisional Army of the Confederate
   States on March 1, 1861.^[152][4] (He was promoted on July 21 to be one
   of the eventual seven [153]full generals in the Confederate Army; his
   date of rank made him the fifth most senior general, behind [154]Samuel
   Cooper, [155]Albert Sidney Johnston, [156]Robert E. Lee, and
   [157]Joseph E. Johnston.)^[158][13]

   Arriving in Charleston on March 3, 1861, Beauregard met with Governor
   [159]Pickens and inspected the defenses of the harbor, which he found
   to be in disarray. He was said to display "a great deal in the way of
   zeal and energy ... but little professional knowledge and
   experience."^[160][14] Major Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter wrote to
   Washington, D.C., that his former West Point student would guarantee
   that South Carolina's actions would be exercised with "skill and sound
   judgment." Beauregard wrote to the Confederate capital of
   [161]Montgomery, Alabama, that Anderson was a "most gallant officer",
   and sent several cases of fine brandy and whiskey and boxes of cigars
   to Anderson and his officers at Sumter. Anderson ordered that the gifts
   be returned.^[162][15]

   Political tensions mounted by early April and Beauregard demanded that
   Sumter surrender before a planned Union expedition to re-provision the
   fort could arrive. Early in the morning of April 12, negotiations with
   Anderson had failed and aides of Beauregard, sent to deal personally
   with Anderson, ordered the first shots of the [163]American Civil War
   to be fired from nearby Fort Johnson. The [164]bombardment of Fort
   Sumter lasted for 34 hours. Subjected to thousands of rounds fired from
   batteries ringing the harbor, Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter on April
   14. Biographer T. Harry Williams described the extravagant praise from
   throughout the Confederacy that Beauregard received for his victory:
   "He was the South's first [165]paladin."^[166][16]

[[167]edit] First Bull Run (First Manassas)

   Summoned to the new Confederate capital of [168]Richmond, Virginia,
   Beauregard received a hero's welcome at the railroad stations along the
   route. He was given command of the "Alexandria Line"^[169][17] of
   defenses against an impending Federal offensive that was being
   organized by Brig. Gen. [170]Irvin McDowell (one of Beauregard's West
   Point classmates) against the Confederate railroad junction at
   [171]Manassas. Beauregard devised strategies to concentrate the forces
   of (full) General [172]Joseph E. Johnston from the [173]Shenandoah
   Valley with his own, aiming not only to defend his position, but to
   initiate an offensive against McDowell and Washington. Despite his
   seniority in rank, Johnston lacked familiarity with the terrain and
   ceded tactical planning of the impending battle to the more junior
   Beauregard as a professional courtesy. President Davis considered many
   of Beauregard's plans to be impractical for an army as inexperienced as
   the Confederates could field in 1861; throughout the war, Davis and
   Beauregard would argue about Beauregard's tendencies to devise grand
   strategies based on formal military principles. Davis believed he
   lacked a pragmatic grasp of logistics, intelligence, relative military
   strengths, and politics.^[174][18]
   Start of the First Battle of Bull Run.

   The [175]First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) began early on July
   21, 1861, with an element of surprise for both armies— both McDowell
   and Beauregard planned to envelop their opponent with an attack from
   their right flank.^[176][19] McDowell struck first, crossing [177]Bull
   Run and threatening Beauregard's left flank. For a while, Beauregard
   persisted in moving his troops for an attack on his right flank
   (McDowell's left, toward [178]Centreville), but Johnston urged him to
   travel with him to the threatened flank at [179]Henry House Hill, which
   was weakly defended. Seeing the strength of the Union attack at that
   point, Beauregard insisted that Johnston leave the area of immediate
   action and coordinate the overall battle from a position 1.5 miles (2.4
   km) to the rear. Beauregard rallied the troops, riding among the men,
   brandishing regimental colors, and giving inspirational speeches. The
   Confederate line held.^[180][20]

   As Johnston's final troops arrived from the Shenandoah Valley, the
   Confederates launched a counterattack that routed the Union Army,
   sending it streaming in disorder back toward Washington. [181]William
   C. Davis credits Johnston with the majority of the tactical decisions
   that led to the victory, judging that "Beauregard acted chiefly as a
   dime novel general, leading the charge of an individual regiment,
   riding along the line to cheer the troops, accepting the huzzas of the
   soldiers and complementing them in turn. The closest he came to a major
   tactical decision was his fleeting intention to withdraw from the Henry
   Hill line when he briefly mistook [the advance of Johnston's
   reinforcements for the arrival of fresh Union troops]."^[182][21]
   Nonetheless, Beauregard received the bulk of the acclaim from the press
   and general public. On July 23, Johnston recommended to President Davis
   that Beauregard be promoted to full general. Davis approved and
   Beauregard's date of rank was established as the date of his victory,
   July 21.^[183][22]
   Beauregard's Battle Flag

   After Bull Run, Beauregard advocated the use of a standardized battle
   flag other than the [184]"Stars and Bars" Confederate national flag to
   avoid visual confusion with the [185]U.S. flag. He worked with Johnston
   and [186]William Porcher Miles to create the [187]Confederate Battle
   Flag. Confederate ladies visiting Beauregard's army contributed silk
   material from their dresses to create the first three flags, for
   Beauregard, Johnston, and [188]Earl Van Dorn; thus, the first flags
   contained more feminine pink than martial red.^[189][23] Throughout his
   career, Beauregard worked to have the flag adopted, and he helped to
   make it the most popular symbol of the Confederacy.^[190][24]

   As the Army went into winter quarters, Beauregard caused considerable
   friction with the Confederate high command. He strongly advocated an
   invasion of [191]Maryland to threaten the flank and rear of Washington.
   With his plan rebuffed as impractical, he requested reassignment to New
   Orleans, which he assumed would be under Union attack in the near
   future, but his request was denied. He quarreled with Commissary
   General [192]Lucius B. Northrop (a personal friend of Davis's) about
   the inadequate supplies available to his army. He issued public
   statements challenging the ability of the Confederate [193]Secretary of
   War to give commands to a full general. And he enraged President Davis
   when his report about Bull Run was printed in the newspaper, which
   suggested that Davis's interference with Beauregard's plans prevented
   the pursuit and full destruction of McDowell's army and the capture of
   Washington.^[194][25]

[[195]edit] Shiloh and Corinth

   Map of the [196]Battle of Shiloh, afternoon of April 6, 1862, after
   Beauregard took command.

   Having become a political liability in Virginia, Beauregard was
   transferred to [197]Tennessee to become second-in-command to General
   [198]Albert Sidney Johnston (no relation to Joseph E. Johnston) in his
   [199]Army of Mississippi, effective March 14, 1862. The two generals
   planned the concentration of Confederate forces to oppose the advance
   of Maj. Gen. [200]Ulysses S. Grant before he could combine his army
   with that of Maj. Gen. [201]Don Carlos Buell in a thrust up the
   [202]Tennessee River toward [203]Corinth, Mississippi. In the
   [204]Battle of Shiloh, which began April 6, 1862, the Confederates
   launched a surprise attack against Grant's [205]Army of the Tennessee
   and nearly defeated it. Once again a more senior general named Johnston
   deferred to the junior Beauregard in planning the attack. The massive
   frontal assault was marred by Beauregard's improper organization of
   forces—successive attacks by corps in lines 3 miles (4.8 km) long,
   rather than assigning each corps a discrete portion of the line for a
   side-by-side assault. This arrangement caused intermingling of units
   and confusion of command; it failed to concentrate mass at the
   appropriate place on the line to affect the overall objectives of the
   attack. In midafternoon, Johnston, who was near the front of the battle
   action, was mortally wounded. Beauregard, positioned in the rear of the
   army to send reinforcements forward, assumed command of the army and
   Johnston's overall Western department (officially designated
   "Department Number Two"). As darkness fell, he chose to call off the
   attack against Grant's final defensive line, which had contracted into
   a tight semicircle backed up to the Tennessee River at Pittsburg
   Landing.^[206][26]

   Beauregard's decision was one of the most controversial of the Civil
   War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have
   happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard
   believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish
   off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep
   ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult
   and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery. Unbeknownst
   to Beauregard, Buell's [207]Army of the Ohio began arriving that
   afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April
   7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.^[208][27]

   Grant was temporarily disgraced by the surprise attack and near defeat,
   causing his superior, Maj. Gen. [209]Henry W. Halleck, to assume field
   command of the combined armies. Halleck cautiously and slowly
   approached Beauregard's fortifications at Corinth; his action became
   derisively called the [210]Siege of Corinth. Beauregard withdrew from
   Corinth on May 29 to [211]Tupelo, Mississippi. He was able to deceive
   Halleck into thinking the Confederates were about to attack; he ran
   empty trains back and forth through the town while whistles blew and
   troops cheered as if massive reinforcements were arriving. Beauregard
   retreated because of the overwhelming Union force and because of
   contaminated water supplies in Corinth. In April and May, the
   Confederates lost almost as many men to death by disease in Corinth as
   had been killed in battle at Shiloh. Nevertheless, his leaving the
   critical rail junction at Corinth without a fight was another
   controversial decision. When Beauregard went on medical leave without
   requesting permission in advance, President Davis relieved him of
   command and replaced him with Gen. [212]Braxton Bragg.^[213][28]

[[214]edit] Return to Charleston

   At Beauregard's request, his allies in the Confederate Congress
   petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis remained
   angry at Beauregard's absence and told him he should have stayed at his
   post even if he had to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, "If the
   whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command
   which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse
   it."^[215][29] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of
   coastal defenses in South Carolina, [216]Georgia, and
   [217]Florida,^[218][30] replacing Maj. Gen. [219]John C. Pemberton. The
   latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command
   the defenses of [220]Vicksburg, Mississippi.^[221][31]

   Beauregard was unhappy with his new assignment, believing that he
   deserved command of one of the great Confederate field armies. He
   performed successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston
   by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, [222]Rear
   Admiral [223]Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the [224]South
   Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led an [225]ironclad attack against Fort
   Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from
   Beauregard's forces. In July through September 1863, land forces under
   Brig. Gen. [226]Quincy A. Gillmore launched a series of attacks on
   [227]Fort Wagner on [228]Morris Island and other fortifications at the
   mouth of the harbor, while Rear Adm. [229]John A. Dahlgren attempted to
   destroy [230]Fort Sumter. Because the latter operation failed, the
   successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening
   Charleston.^[231][32]

   During this period, Beauregard promoted innovative naval defense
   strategies, such as early experimentation with [232]submarines,
   [233]naval mines (called "torpedoes" in the Civil War), and with a
   small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A swift boat fitted with a torpedo
   on a pole projecting from its bow under water, it could be used to
   surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He
   was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the
   Confederacy. He proposed that some of the state governors meet with
   Union governors of the Western states (what are called the [234]Midwest
   states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected
   the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis's
   enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a grand
   strategy—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it
   was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at
   the expense of Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, destroy the Federal
   army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve
   pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could
   be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce
   the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of
   torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans,
   ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially
   presented to the government.^[235][33]

   While visiting his forces in Florida, which had just repelled a Union
   advance at [236]Jacksonville, Beauregard received a telegram that his
   wife had died on March 2, 1864. Living in Union-occupied New Orleans,
   she had been seriously ill for two years. A Northern-leaning local
   newspaper printed an opinion that her condition had been exacerbated by
   the actions of her husband. This so fanned negative popular opinion
   that 6,000 people attended her funeral. Union Maj. Gen. [237]Nathaniel
   P. Banks provided a steamer to carry her body upriver for burial in her
   native parish. Beauregard wrote that he would like to rescue "her
   hallowed grave" at the head of an army.^[238][34]

[[239]edit] Richmond

   In April 1864, Beauregard saw little opportunity for military glory
   because he foresaw that there would be no more significant assaults
   against Charleston and prospects for a major field command were
   unlikely. He requested a leave to recover from fatigue and a chronic
   throat ailment, but he instead received an order to report to
   [240]Weldon, North Carolina, near the Virginia border, to play a key
   role in the defense of Virginia. His new assignment, the Department of
   North Carolina and Cape Fear, also included Virginia south of the
   [241]James River. When he took command on April 18, he renamed it on
   his own initiative, the Department of North Carolina and Southern
   Virginia. The Confederates were preparing for the spring offensive of
   Union Lt. Gen. [242]Ulysses S. Grant and were concerned that attacks
   south of Richmond could interrupt the critical supply lines to Richmond
   and the army of Robert E. Lee.^[243][35]

   Nothing illustrates better the fundamental weakness of the Confederate
   command system than the weary series of telegrams exchanged in May and
   early June between Davis, Bragg, Beauregard, and Lee. Beauregard evaded
   his responsibility for determining what help he could give Lee; Davis
   and Bragg shirked their responsibility to decide, when he refused. The
   strangest feature of the whole affair was that, in the face of Lee's
   repeated requests, nobody in the high command thought to order
   Beauregard to join Lee.
   T. Harry Williams, Napoleon in Gray^[244][36]

   As Grant moved south against Lee in the [245]Overland Campaign, Maj.
   Gen. [246]Benjamin Butler launched the surprise [247]Bermuda Hundred
   Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully
   lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to
   prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred
   north of Richmond to the aid of Lee. His timely action, coupled with
   the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army,
   nullifying its threat to [248]Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now
   that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops
   from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj.
   Gen. [249]Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the [250]Battle of Cold Harbor, but
   Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard
   command of the right wing of the [251]Army of Northern Virginia for his
   cooperation. Beauregard replied in a [252]passive–aggressive manner, "I
   am willing to do anything for our success, but cannot leave my
   Department without orders of War Department."^[253][37]
   Beauregard's defense of Petersburg, Federal assaults of June 15–18

   After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate high command were unable to
   anticipate Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed
   him to make a prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River
   and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but
   contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite
   persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not
   convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man
   force—including boys, old men, and patients from military
   hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the
   [254]Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda
   Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler
   would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held
   Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his
   finest combat performance of the war.^[255][38]

   Beauregard continued commanding the defenses of Petersburg in the early
   days of the [256]siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the
   [257]Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not
   attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command
   arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his
   desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. [258]Jubal
   Early to lead an expedition north through the [259]Shenandoah Valley
   and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. [260]John Bell Hood
   to replace the faltering [261]Joseph E. Johnston in the [262]Atlanta
   Campaign.^[263][39]

[[264]edit] Return to the West

   After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis considered
   replacing John Bell Hood in command of the Army of Tennessee and he
   asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested.
   Beauregard was interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously
   considered the appointment and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis
   met with Beauregard in [265]Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered
   him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible
   for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River,
   with the armies of Hood and [266]Richard Taylor under his ostensible
   command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical
   and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the
   armies unless he joined them in person during an emergency.
   Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the
   assignment.^[267][40]

   The major field operation of the fall was Hood's
   [268]Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he
   undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational
   or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due
   to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and
   making movements without regard to the consequences for his supply
   line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled
   through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. [269]William T.
   Sherman began his [270]March to the Sea from Atlanta to [271]Savannah,
   which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was
   ineffective stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had
   inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other
   locations to concentrate. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of
   deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of
   his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to
   march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December,
   Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its
   defeat at the [272]Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in
   fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.^[273][41]

   Beauregard attempted to concentrate his small forces before Sherman
   could reach Columbia, South Carolina, the state capital. His urgent
   dispatches to Richmond were treated with disbelief—Davis and Robert E.
   Lee (now the general in chief of all the Confederate armies) could not
   believe that Sherman was advancing without a supply line as quickly as
   Beauregard was observing. Also concerned about what he considered
   Beauregard's "feeble health," Lee recommended to Davis that he be
   replaced by Joseph E. Johnston. The change of command came on February
   22 and Beauregard, although outwardly cooperative and courteous to
   Johnston, was bitterly disappointed at his replacement. For the
   remainder of the war, Beauregard was Johnston's subordinate, assigned
   to routine matters without combat responsibilities. Johnston and
   Beauregard surrendered to Sherman near [274]Durham, North Carolina, on
   April 26, 1865, and were paroled in [275]Greensboro on May 2.
   Beauregard traveled to Mobile and then took a U.S. naval transport to
   his hometown of New Orleans.^[276][42]

[[277]edit] Postbellum life

   Beauregard, later in life.

   After the war, Beauregard was reluctant to seek amnesty as a former
   Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both
   Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor
   of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He was one of many Confederate
   officers issued a mass pardon by Pres. [278]Andrew Johnson on July 4,
   1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for
   public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief
   and the bill on his behalf was signed by Pres. Grant on July 24,
   1876.^[279][43]

   Beauregard pursued a commission in the [280]Brazilian Army in 1865, but
   declined the one that was offered. He claimed that the positive
   attitude of Pres. Johnson toward the South swayed his decision. "I
   prefer to live here, poor and forgotten, than to be endowed with honor
   and riches in a foreign country." He also declined offers to take
   command of the armies of [281]Romania and [282]Egypt.^[283][44]

   As a life-long [284]Democrat, Beauregard worked to end [285]Republican
   rule during [286]Reconstruction. His outrage over the excesses of
   Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about
   remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies,
   which lasted until 1875. He was active in the Reform Party, an
   association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in
   favor of [287]civil rights and voting for the recently freed
   [288]slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and
   Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state
   legislature.^[289][45]

   Beauregard's first employment following the war was in October 1865 as
   chief engineer and general superintendent of the New Orleans, Jackson,
   and Great Northern Railroad. In 1866 he was promoted to president, a
   position he retained until 1870, when he was ousted in a hostile
   takeover. This job overlapped with that of president of the [290]New
   Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a
   system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard
   made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders
   who wished to take direct management of the company.^[291][46]

   After the loss of these two railway executive positions, Beauregard
   spent time briefly at a variety of companies and civil engineering
   pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited
   as a supervisor of the [292]Louisiana Lottery in 1877. He and former
   Confederate general [293]Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and
   made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some
   respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these
   positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored
   gambling and the lottery was closed down by the legislature.^[294][47]

   Beauregard's military writings include Principles and Maxims of the Art
   of War (1863), Report on the Defense of Charleston, and A Commentary on
   the Campaign and Battle of Manassas (1891). He was the uncredited
   co-author of his friend Alfred Roman's The Military Operations of
   General Beauregard in the War Between the States (1884). He contributed
   the article "The Battle of Bull Run" to Century Illustrated Monthly
   Magazine in November 1884. During these years, Beauregard and Davis
   published a series of bitter accusations and counter-accusations
   retrospectively blaming each other for the Confederate
   defeat.^[295][48]

   Beauregard served as [296]adjutant general for the Louisiana state
   militia, 1879–88. In 1888, he was elected as commissioner of
   [297]public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died
   in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence
   to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the
   children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand
   marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the
   cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson
   Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral
   procession, saying "We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I am
   sorry he is gone. I am no hypocrite."^[298][49]

   Beauregard died in his sleep in New Orleans. The cause of death was
   "heart disease, aortic insufficiency, and probably
   [299]myocarditis."^[300][50] [301]Edmund Kirby Smith, the last
   surviving full general of the Confederacy, served as the "chief
   mourner" as Beauregard was interred in the vault of the [302]Army of
   Tennessee in historic [303]Metairie Cemetery.^[304][51]

[[305]edit] In memoriam

   [306]Beauregard Parish in western Louisiana is named for general
   Beauregard, as is [307]Camp Beauregard, a National Guard camp near
   [308]Pineville in central Louisiana.

   An equestrian monument by [309]Alexander Doyle depicts Beauregard at
   Beauregard Circle, the intersection where [310]Esplanade Avenue enters
   [311]City Park in New Orleans.

   Beauregard's residence in New Orleans is now called the
   Beauregard-Keyes House, and is operated as a historic house
   museum.^[312][52]

       – June 2), the Alexandria Line (June 2 – June 20), and the
       [336]Confederate Army of the Potomac (June 20 – July 21). After the
       First Battle of Bull Run, Joseph E. Johnston merged his [337]Army
       of the Shenandoah with Beauregard's and commanded the overall
       force, which was later renamed the [338]Army of Northern Virginia.
       Beauregard persisted in calling his part of the army the Army of
       the Potomac, although he was in essence a corps commander in that
       army, reporting to Johnston until March 14, 1862.
