[[18]edit] Early life

   Dyar grew up in [19]Concord, Massachusetts. As a young man he initially
   made a living as an apprentice [20]watchmaker, working for the Concord
   [21]clockmaker Lemuel Curtis from 1818 to 1825. For many years he lived
   in Paris where he made a good living as a chemist. In 1858 he returned
   to America and settled in New York City. He married May 9,
   1865.^[22][1]

[[23]edit] Notability

   Alfred Munroe in Concord and the Telegraph records that Dyar and his
   brother Joseph were interested in the newly developed technology of
   electricity.^[24][2] They came up with the idea of transmitting a
   message over electrical wire. Dyar experimented and finally concluded
   that he had discovered how a message could be transmitted over a single
   wire.^[25][3] In 1826 he and his brother laid a wire line along the
   "Causeway", later called Lowell Road and the Red Bridge Road, that
   proved the technique viable.^[26][4] According to [27]Colonel William
   Whiting of Concord, the [28]telegraph wire was strung from the trees
   along the Red Bridge Road over the Concord River at Hunt’s Bridge and
   went all the way to Curtis’s residence. Dyar used [29]apothecary vial
   jars as glass insulators for the bare iron wire.^[30][2]
   19th century telegraph pole

   Dyar erected the first telegraph line and dispatched over it the first
   telegraph message ever sent in America^[31][5] — as determined by
   [32]Levi Woodbury of the [33]Supreme Court of the United
   States.^[34][6] Dyar had used over half a mile of bare electrical wire
   to transmit the message. He employed mechanical and electrical means
   that [35]Samuel Morse used many years later for the telegraph system he
   patented in 1847.^[36][2] The author Munroe explains that Dyar made his
   telegraph line at least eighteen years before the actual
   materialization of the first practical Morse telegraph line that was
   made between Washington, D.C., and [37]Baltimore, Maryland.^[38][7]

   According to Munroe it was Dyar, not Morse, who erected the first real
   telegraph line at the race track in Long Island in 1826^[39][8] and
   dispatched the first message ever sent.^[40][9] This was years prior to
   the joint patent of electric telegraphy by [41]William Fothergill Cooke
   and [42]Charles Wheatstone taken out in 1837 in England. Alfred Munroe
   writes in his book "Concord and the Telegraph", This may seem strange
   to most of our readers. The credit of this great discovery has been
   generally conceded to Professor Morse, but the latter deserves credit
   only for combining and applying the discoveries of others. Dyar had
   erected his telegraph line some six years before Morse even began his
   investigation on [43]telegraphy and some ten years before he began to
   talk about the subject.^[44][2] Because of threats with prosecution for
   "Conspiracy to send Secret Communications in advance of the Mail" Dyar
   abandoned his work.^[45][8]

[[46]edit] Dyar’s telegraph technology

   Dyar recorded the sparks generated by the electrical current of his
   telegraph on a ribbon of moistened [47]litmus paper^[48][10] on a spool
   that revolved mechanically by a clockwork apparatus. The [49]nitric
   acid that was formed on the litmus paper by the action of the
   electricity left appropriate legible small red marks for designated
   letters. Dyar’s method was of frictional [50]electrolytic^[51][10]
   nature where Morse’s was an [52]electromagnetic usage.^[53][2]

   Dyar’s early experiments using this method worked quite well. In fact
   his experiments proved his theory would work and impressed several
   investors. He was able to get an advanced loan in New-York to run a
   line at the Long Island race-course in 1827.^[54][10] Dyar then
   proposed to string a wire across New Jersey from New York to
   Philadelphia. However, the New Jersey legislature was skeptical on the
   issue because of security reasons. They even condemned Dyar as being
   dangerous because they thought he was some kind of a "wizard." They
   refused permission for this experiment of Dyar's because of fear of
   sending secret communications in advance of the mail.^[55][2]

   There is an argument amongst historians that Morse got several of
   Dyar’s plans for the telegraph from him. Morse married the sister of
   one of Dyar’s associates named Charles Walker. Walker had worked with
   Dyar on the telegraph and had retained many of Dyar’s sketches.
   Historians speculate that either Charles Walker or his sister (Lucretia
   Pickering Walker) might well have shown those sketches to
   Morse.^[56][2] One idea supposedly "borrowed" was that Dyar used
   batteries and had the idea of sending electric impulses along a single
   wire. Dyar also had the idea of spacing the sparks in such a way as to
   form an alphabetic code and developed out this code years before Morse
   developed his [57]Morse Code.

[[58]edit] Later life

   Dyar moved to Paris because of so much opposition to his telegraph
   technology.^[59][1] He was the father of [60]Harrison Gray Dyar, Jr.

    3. [73]^ Lane, p. 31: Harrison Gray Dyar, is the name of the American
       who first conceived the idea of sending messages over a wire by
       means of electric fluid.
    4. [74]^ Lane, p. 32
    5. [75]^ Swayne, p. 241: "Harrison Gray Dyar of Concord erected the
       first real line and despatched the first message over it by
       electricity ever sent by such means in America. This may seem
       strange to most of our readers," says Alfred Munroe in Concord and
       the Telegraph, "as the credit of this great discovery has been
       generally conceded to Prof. Morse, but the latter deserves credit
       only for combining and applying the discovery of others."
    6. [76]^ Crew, p. 465: On this point, too, it may be well to state
       that, according to the decision of Levi Woodbury, when a Justice of
       the Supreme Court of the United States, messages were sent by means
       of electricity so long ago as in 1827, the inventor of the
       telegraph being Harrison Gray Dyar.
    7. [77]^ Swayne, p. 241: Among the earliest of ‘those others’ was a
       young man once a resident of this town. At least eighteen years
       before the actual materialization of the first Morse telegraph
       line, a message had been transmitted over half a mile of wire in
       Concord by means that in many respects are identical with those
       employed by Morse.
