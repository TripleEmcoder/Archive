[[22]edit] Early career

   Quinn Cummings began her career after being discovered by famed
   [23]cinematographer [24]James Wong Howe. She soon began landing roles
   in numerous television commercials, eventually winning the role of
   [25]Marsha Mason's daughter, Lucy McFadden, in the [26]1977 film The
   Goodbye Girl. Cummings' performance was nominated for an [27]Academy
   Award for Best Supporting Actress and a [28]Golden Globe Award for Best
   Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.^[29][1]

   In 1978, Cummings landed a recurring role on the drama series
   [30]Family. In 1985, Cummings also appeared in the short-lived [31]ABC
   sitcom, [32]Hail to the Chief, playing the daughter of the first female
   [33]President of the United States (played by [34]Patty Duke).

   During the late-1980s, Cummings acted occasionally and worked as a
   casting agent. In the 1990s, she quit acting because she wasn't
   comfortable living her life in the public eye and stated that,
   ..."nobody could conceive of hiring me". She went on to attend [35]UCLA
   for two years, and had a stint recruiting writers to publish short
   stories online.^[36][1] Her last acting role was in a 1991 episode of
   [37]Blossom.

[[38]edit] Personal life

   In June 2000, Cummings gave birth to a daughter. She currently lives in
   [39]Los Feliz, California with her daughter and her long-time
   boyfriend.^[40][1]

[[41]edit] Recent years

   Inspired by the birth of her first child, Cummings created the
   HipHugger, a sling-type device for carrying a baby. She began selling
   the HipHugger and is now the president of the HipHugger
   company.^[42][1]

   In February 2005, Cummings created [43]The QC Report , a blog which
   discusses the ironies of modern life from the point of view of a
   career-mom in her thirties. It has received numerous recommendations
   including [44]Newsweek's BlogWatch pick of the week. Cummings has also
   appeared in magazines such as Los Angeles and [45]Good Housekeeping.

   Cummings' first book, "Notes From The Underwire: Adventures from My
   Awkward and Lovely Life" was published in July 2009 by Hyperion Books
   [46][1].
