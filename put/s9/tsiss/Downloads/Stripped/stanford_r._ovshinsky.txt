   Stanford R. Ovshinsky (born November 24, 1922, in Akron, Ohio) is an
   American [14]inventor and [15]scientist who has been granted
   approximately 400 [16]patents over the last fifty years, mostly in the
   areas of energy or information.^[17][1] Many of his inventions have had
   wide ranging applications. Among the most prominent are: an
   environmentally friendly [18]nickel-metal hydride battery, which has
   been widely used in [19]laptop computers, [20]digital cameras, [21]cell
   phones, and [22]electric and [23]hybrid cars; continuous web
   multi-junction flexible thin-film [24]solar energy laminates and
   panels; flat screen [25]liquid crystal displays; rewritable [26]CD and
   [27]DVD computer memories; [28]hydrogen fuel cells; and nonvolatile
   phase-change [29]electronic memories.^[30][2] Ovshinsky opened the
   scientific field of amorphous and disordered materials in the course of
   his research in the 1940s and 50s in [31]neurophysiology, neural
   disease, the nature of intelligence in mammals and machines, and
   [32]cybernetics.^[33][3] [34]Amorphous silicon [35]semiconductors have
   become the basis of many technologies and industries. Ovshinsky is also
   distinguished in being [36]self-taught, without formal college or
   graduate training.^[37][4] Throughout his life, his love for science
   and his social convictions were the primary engines for his inventive
   work.^[38][5]

   In 1960 Ovshinsky and his soon-to-be second wife, [39]Iris Dibner,
   founded Energy Conversion Laboratory in a storefront in [40]Detroit,
   dedicating the laboratory to the solution of important societal
   problems using science and technology.^[41][6] Focusing on the critical
   areas of energy and information, their new company, reconstituted in
   1964 as [42]Energy Conversion Devices (ECD), went on to become a
   forefront invention and development laboratory whose products have
   built new industries, many of them aimed at making [43]fossil fuel
   obsolete. ECD continues (through joint ventures and license partners)
   to be a leading [44]solar energy and [45]battery production
   firm.^[46][7]

   Roughly a year after Iris Ovshinsky's death in August 2006, Ovshinsky
   left ECD and established a new company, Ovshinsky Innovation LLC,
   devoted to developing the scientific basis for highly innovative and
   revolutionary energy and information technologies. In October 2007 he
   married Rosa Young, a physicist who had worked at ECD on numerous
   energy technologies including a hydrogen-powered hybrid car and on
   Ovshinsky’s vision of a hydrogen-based economy.

[[61]edit] Early life

   Ovshinsky was born and grew up in the industrial town of [62]Akron,
   Ohio, then at the center of the American rubber industry. The elder son
   of working-class Jewish immigrant parents who escaped [63]Eastern
   Europe around 1905—Benjamin Ovshinsky from [64]Lithuania and Bertha
   Munitz from what is now [65]Belarus—Ovshinsky became active in social
   activities at an early age during the [66]Great Depression.^[67][8] His
   lifelong concern to better the lives of workers and minorities, as well
   as to advance culture and the interests of industry, derive largely
   from his father, who was a generous, liberal, and highly cultured
   activist. With his horse and wagon, and later his truck, Ben Ovshinsky
   made his living collecting [68]metal scrap from [69]factories and
   [70]foundries.^[71][9] Based on his father's example, and on teachings
   offered by the Akron [72]Workmen's Circle, an organization mainly of
   Jewish immigrants who believed in [73]social justice, Stan Ovshinsky
   developed a deep commitment to social values, including [74]labor
   rights, [75]civil rights and [76]civil liberties.^[77][10]

[[78]edit] Work through the 1950s

[[79]edit] Work as a machinist and the Benjamin Center Drive

   Before graduating from high school in June 1941, he worked as a
   [80]tool maker and [81]machinist in various local shops affiliated with
   the rubber industry.^[82][11] During the [83]Second World War, he and
   his bride Norma Rifkin moved to [84]Arizona where Stan worked for a
   time in the tool room of a Goodyear plant in Litchfield, not far from
   [85]Phoenix. Returning to [86]Akron shortly before the end of the war,
   Ovshinsky eventually established his own machine company, Stanford
   Roberts, initially in a barn.^[87][12] There he developed and patented
   his first invention, the Benjamin Center Drive, named after his
   father.^[88][13] This unique automatic high-speed center drive
   [89]lathe had many important uses. After Ovshinsky sold his company to
   the New Britain Machine Company in [90]Connecticut, it was used to help
   solve the national crisis of making [91]artillery shells in large
   enough volume for wartime needs during the [92]Korean War. Meanwhile
   Ovshinsky continued to develop his growing interest in human and
   machine intelligence, avidly studying the research literature on
   [93]neurophysiology, neurological disease, and [94]cybernetics,
   corresponding briefly with [95]Norbert Wiener.^[96][14]

[[97]edit] Intelligent machines

   In 1951, Ovshinsky accepted an offer to move to [98]Detroit and work in
   the [99]automotive industry as the director of research at the Hupp
   Motorcar Company. Continuing his work on intelligent machines he
   invented electric power steering, but Hupp’s president was opposed to
   completing the arrangements with [100]General Motors to utilize the
   product. Not long after that, Stan and his younger brother Herb
   Ovshinsky, a talented [101]mechanical engineer, established a small
   company called General Automation in a Detroit storefront. There Stan
   continued his study of intelligent machines and embarked on early
   research and development of various energy and information
   technologies. At the same time began studying [102]neurophysiology and
   neurological diseases.^[103][15] On the basis of his early writings
   about [104]nerve impulses and the nature of intelligence he was in June
   1955 invited by [105]Wayne Medical School to participate in pioneering
   experimental research on the mammalian cerebellum.

[[106]edit] The Ovitron

   By the late 1950s, working at General Automation, Ovshinsky brought
   together these disparate studies in an [107]invention. Crossing
   [108]scientific disciplines that [109]academics traditionally hold
   separate, including [110]neurophysiology and [111]cybernetics, Stan
   invented and Herb Ovshinsky helped build a mechanical model of a
   [112]nerve cell, an amorphous thin-film switch they called the Ovitron.
   Stan [113]patented the device and the brothers disclosed it publicly in
   1959 in New York City. In an attempt to model the learning ability of
   nerve cells, which Stan recognized as deriving from the [114]plasticity
   of the cell's membrane, he drew on his knowledge of surfaces and
   materials to fashion very thin layers of amorphous material, thus
   pioneering the use of [115]nanostructures. He created these layers by
   combining elements, especially from the [116]Group 16 elements under
   [117]oxygen, known as [118]chalcogenides, including [119]sulphur,
   [120]selenium, and [121]tellurium. He would continue to work with
   chalcogenides in his inventions for decades to come.^[122][16]

[[123]edit] Work from 1960

[[124]edit] Energy Conversion Laboratory

   On January 1, 1960, Ovshinsky and Iris Miroy Dibner, whom Stan married
   soon after his divorce from Norma Rifkin, founded Energy Conversion
   Laboratory to develop Stan’s inventions in the interest of solving
   societal problems, especially those they identified in the areas of
   information and energy, for example, pollution and wars over oil.
   ^[125][17] Iris had a BA in [126]Zoology from [127]Swarthmore College,
   an MS in [128]Biology from the [129]University of Michigan, and a PhD
   in [130]Biochemistry from [131]Boston University.^[132][18] Continuing
   to work on his atomically designed chalcogenide materials, which
   Ovshinsky realized offer unique electronic physical mechanisms,
   Ovshinsky utilized chain structures, cross links, polymeric concepts,
   and divalent structural bonding with a huge number of unbounded lone
   pairs to achieve what is now referred to as the Ovshinsky Effect, “an
   effect that turns special types of glassy, thin films into
   semiconductors upon application of low voltage.”^[133][19] Applying
   this effect he built new types of electronic and optical switches,
   including his Ovonic Phase Change Memory and his Threshold Switch. The
   former would become the basis of his subsequent inventions of
   rewritable CDs and DVDs and other new computer technologies including
   his cognitive computer.^[134][20] While others working in the
   crystalline field were building devices based on bulk materials,
   Ovshinsky’s work in the 1960s and later continued to be based on
   [135]thin films and nanostructures.^[136][21] Recognizing the
   significance of his results, Ovshinsky applied for a patent on June 21,
   1961 and in 1962 made his first licensing pact on [137]phase change
   memory.

[[138]edit] Energy conversion devices

   By the spring of 1963, the Ovshinskys had exhausted the savings with
   which they had initially funded ECL. Before seeking public funding,
   Stan wanted validation of the importance of his work from a
   well-recognized scientist. He telephoned [139]John Bardeen, a co
   inventor of the [140]transistor and codiscoverer of the [141]BCS theory
   of superconductivity, by this time a [142]Nobel Laureate. Bardeen
   immediately recognized the importance of Ovshinsky’s result but his
   schedule did not permit him to visit ECL for five months. Stan replied,
   “We’ll be broke by then.”^[143][22] Instead Bardeen sent [144]Hellmut
   Fritzsche, a [145]University of Chicago physicist. Fritzsche became
   very positive in his support of Ovshinsky’s work and helped attract
   other scientists to the Ovshinsky laboratory. As Fritzsche and Brian
   Schwartz later wrote, “There is a mysterious quality in Ovshinsky’s
   persona that attracts people into his sphere, builds life long
   friendships and awakens deep respect and devotion. Meeting him leaves
   each person with a deep impression of his superior intellect, his self
   confidence, his compassion to improve society combined with his
   certainty that his vision can be realized. His enthusiasm is
   contagious. In his presence, you feel how exciting it would be to join
   him in his endeavors.”^[146][23] Among the many famous scientists who
   came regularly to ECD as friends or collaborators over the next years,
   were [147]David Adler, Bardeen, Arthur Bienenstock, Morrel Cohen,
   [148]Kenichi Fukui, [149]William Lipscomb, [150]Sir Nevill Mott,
   [151]Linus Pauling, [152]Isadore I. Rabi, [153]Edward Teller,
   [154]David Turnbull, [155]Victor Weisskopf, and [156]Robert R.
   Wilson.^[157][24] Some joined as consultants or as members of the Board
   of Directors. Meanwhile, the ECD community developed a uniquely
   productive nonhierarchical multicultural and international culture
   reflecting Stan and Iris’ social values. In 1964, Stan and Iris changed
   the laboratory’s name to Energy Conversion Devices, at the time when
   the company moved to larger quarters in [158]Troy, Michigan.

   The laboratory continued to develop electronic memories, batteries, and
   solar cells, reinvesting almost every penny of profit into the
   scientific study of a wide variety of problems, many of which later
   became the basis of lucrative industries, e.g., flat screen [159]liquid
   crystal displays. In time license fees to ECD began to grow, especially
   when amorphous silicon was used to make solar cells “by the mile,” with
   an approach that originated from the non-silver photographic film work
   on which Ovshinsky had been working.^[160][25] It led to the bold
   approach of using the first continuous web photovoltaic machine,
   designed and built under Stan’s direction by Herb Ovshinsky and a small
   group in the machine division. Generations of machines later resulted
   in sufficient monies to build Ovshinsky’s objective of having a 30
   megawatt machine rather than a 5 megawatt machine. Despite considerable
   skepticism toward the machine, it is now being cloned very successfully
   by ECD in new plants.^[161][26] ECD also gained profits from the nickel
   metal hydride batteries which were important for a time in laptop
   computers and continue to be important in [162]hybrid gas-electric
   automobiles.^[163][27]

[[164]edit] Ovshinsky Innovation LLC

   On August 16, 2006, Iris Ovshinsky, Stan's wife and partner of almost
   fifty years, died suddenly while swimming.^[165][28] A year later
   Ovshinsky retired from ECD and Ovshinsky launched a new company
   together with Rosa Young, whom he later married. At Ovshinsky
   Innovation LLC, Stan is continuing his work on information and energy
   science, in strong relationships with colleagues and with industrial
   partners (for example, Ovonyx, which is developing phase-change
   semiconductor memory). Ovshinsky Innovation is focusing presently on a
   new kind of photovoltaic plant based on a new concept promising to
   lower the cost of photovoltaic energy sources below that of
   coal.^[166][29] This latter innovation would help realize Ovshinsky's
   long-term goal over the last half-century to make fossil fuels obsolete
   while at the same time providing countless jobs in new industries. And
   ECD is becoming recognized as the company that "developed solar roofing
   shingles in the 1980s," is making "the best available flexible thin
   film in the world," and is one of the first companies to work on
   [167]building-integrated photovoltaics ([168]BIPV) ^[169][30] Because
   of Ovshinsky’s independent and radical contributions to science, he has
   been compared with [170]Einstein.^[171][31] Because of his many
   inventions in [172]digital memory, [173]solar energy, battery
   technology, optical media, and solid hydrogen storage and his hundreds
   of basic scientific patents, he has often been compared with
   [174]Thomas Edison.^[175][32] In the area of alternatives to fossil
   fuel, his pioneering work has caused many writers to refer to him as
   “the modern world’s most important energy visionary.”^[176][33]

[[177]edit] Honors and awards

   With more than 300 publications on his scientific vitae, Ovshinsky has
   won many prizes for his contributions to science and
   innovation.^[178][34] He is a fellow of the [179]American Physical
   Society, the [180]American Association for the Advancement of Science
   and the [181]Engineering Society of Detroit. His awards include: the
   2005 Innovation Award for Energy and the Environment by [182]The
   Economist; the [183]American Solar Energy Society Hoyt Clarke Hottel
   Award; the Karl W. Böer Solar Energy Medal of Merit; the International
   Association for Hydrogen Energy Sir William Grove Award; the Frederick
   Douglass/Eugene V. Debs Award (2006); and the 2009 Thomas Midgley Award
   from the Detroit Section of the American Chemical Society.

   He was named “Hero for the Planet" by [184]TIME magazine (1999), with
   Iris Ovshinsky Hero of Chemistry 2000 by the [185]American Chemical
   Society, and he was inducted into the 2005 Solar Hall of Fame.

   In 1968, he received the Diesel Gold Medal presented by the German
   Inventors Association (Deutscher Erfinderverband), in recognition of
   his discovery of the semiconductor switching effect in disordered and
   amorphous materials.

   On December 11, 2010 Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of
   Engineering degree from [186]Kettering University, [187]Flint,
   Michigan. ^[188][35]

   On May 1, 2010 Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science
   degree from [189]University of Michigan, [190]Ann Arbor, Michigan.

   On May 7, 2009, Ovshinsky was awarded an [191]Honorary Doctorate in
   Science from [192]Wayne State University, [193]Detroit, Michigan.

   On May 16, 2009, Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of
   Engineering from [194]Illinois Institute of Technology, [195]Chicago,
   Illinois.

   On June 30, 2009, Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from
   [196]Ovidius University, [197]Constanţa, [198]Romania.

   On May 18, 2008, Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science
   from [199]New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, New York.

   On May 8, 2007, Ovshinsky was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science
   from [200]Kean University, Union, New Jersey.

[[201]edit] In popular culture

   Ovshinsky appeared in the documentary [202]Who Killed the Electric Car?
   as well as in parts 1 and 3 of the episode "Hydrogen Hopes" of
   [203]Alan Alda’s television series [204]Scientific American Frontiers.
   The website of Scientific American Frontiers makes "Hydrogen Hopes"
   available for viewing at no charge, as well as the text of an interview
   with Stan and Iris Ovshinsky.[205][1] Ovshinsky was profiled as
   “Japan’s American Genius” in the PBS series [206]NOVA (October 1987).
