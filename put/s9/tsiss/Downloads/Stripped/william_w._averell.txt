   William Woods Averell (November 5, 1832 – February 3, 1900) was a
   career [24]United States Army officer and a [25]cavalry [26]general in
   the [27]American Civil War. After the war he was a diplomat and became
   wealthy by inventing American [28]asphalt pavement.

[[35]edit] Early years

   Averell was born in [36]Cameron, New York. As a boy he worked as a
   drugstore clerk in the nearby town of [37]Bath, New York. He graduated
   from the [38]United States Military Academy at [39]West Point in 1855
   and was commissioned a [40]second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Mounted
   Rifles. His early assignments included garrison duty at [41]Jefferson
   Barracks, [42]Missouri, and the U.S. Army Cavalry School in
   [43]Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During two years of service in the
   southwestern United States, he was wounded in action against the
   [44]Indians in 1859 and was placed on the disabled list until the
   outbreak of the Civil War.

[[45]edit] Civil War

   After the capture of [46]Fort Sumter, Lt. Averell made a risky solo
   journey across the country to the [47]New Mexico Territory with a
   message to summon his old mounted rifle regiment back east to join the
   fighting.

   Averell first saw action at the [48]First Battle of Bull Run while
   acting as assistant adjutant general to [49]Brig. Gen. [50]Andrew
   Porter. In August 1861, he was appointed [51]colonel of the 3rd
   Pennsylvania Cavalry regiment, which he led through the [52]Peninsula
   Campaign and the [53]Seven Days Battles. Immediately after that
   campaign, on July 6, 1862, he was given command of the 1st Cavalry
   Brigade in the [54]Army of the Potomac. He missed the [55]Battle of
   Antietam and most of the [56]Maryland Campaign as he recovered from a
   bout of [57]malaria that was known at the time as "Chickahominy Fever".
   As [58]Confederate Maj. Gen. [59]J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry rode around
   the Union Army and raided [60]Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Averell
   returned in time to lead his brigade in pursuit. He was promoted to
   brigadier general on September 26, 1862.

   During the [61]Battle of Fredericksburg, Averell commanded the Cavalry
   Brigade of the Center Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac. He
   ascended to [62]division command—the 2nd division of the Cavalry
   Corps—on February 12, 1863. His division fought the first engagement in
   which Union cavalrymen claimed victory against their Confederate
   counterparts, the [63]Battle of Kelly's Ford on March 17, 1863.
   (Averell received a [64]brevet promotion to [65]major in the
   [66]regular army for his actions in this battle.) But the 2nd
   Division's reputation was diminished as it participated in [67]Maj.
   Gen. [68]George Stoneman's fruitless cavalry raid in the [69]Battle of
   Chancellorsville six weeks later. On May 2, 1863, army commander Maj.
   Gen. [70]Joseph Hooker relieved Averell of his command due to his slow
   performance during the raid. Hooker sent an angry telegram to the War
   Department informing them that Averell "seems to have contented himself
   between April 29 and May 4 with having marched ... 28 miles, meeting no
   enemy deserving of the name, and from that point reporting to me for
   instructions."

   Averell left the Army of the Potomac after his relief at
   Chancellorsville and fought a series of minor engagements in the
   Department of West Virginia at the brigade and division level. In
   November 1863, he conducted what is called Averell's West Virginia Raid
   against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He received a brevet
   promotion to [71]lieutenant colonel in the regular army for the
   [72]Battle of Droop Mountain in West Virginia on November 6, 1863, and
   to colonel for actions at [73]Salem, Virginia, on December 15, 1863. In
   the spring of 1864, he led another cavalry raid toward Saltville but
   was stopped by Generals [74]John Hunt Morgan and [75]William E.
   "Grumble" Jones at Cove Gap. Returning to West Virginia, he later
   commanded a cavalry division under Maj. Gen. [76]David Hunter in his
   failed raid on [77]Lynchburg.

   At a time when [78]Lt. Gen. [79]Jubal Early had invaded Maryland and
   defeated a series of Union commanders, Averell proved to be the only
   Union commander to achieve victory against the Confederates in the
   Shenandoah Valley. He routed Confederate Maj. Gen. [80]Stephen D.
   Ramseur at the [81]Battle of Rutherford's (Carter's) Farm on July 20,
   inflicting 400 casualties and capturing a four-gun battery, in spite of
   Averell's being significantly outnumbered. When Brig. Gen. [82]John
   McCausland burned [83]Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to the ground on July
   30, Averell tracked him down at [84]Moorefield, West Virginia. Using
   intelligence gathered from his scouts, Averell routed McCausland in a
   sunrise attack upon the Confederate camp capturing hundreds of
   prisoners and another four-gun battery.

   During the [85]Valley Campaigns of 1864 against Early, Averell fought
   under Maj. Gen. [86]Philip Sheridan. He was relieved of command a
   second time in his career on September 23, 1864, following a dispute
   with Sheridan about Averell's actions at the [87]Battle of Fisher's
   Hill. This incident truly devastated him and he could not hide his
   misery. A staff officer wrote "I saw General Averell sitting in front
   of his tent ... He was dreadfully depressed and broken. I believe he
   started for the rear within a few moments after we left him, and never
   was employed again during the war." And yet the Army bureaucracy
   generated a promotion for Averell before the end of the war, to
   [88]brevet major general in the regular army on March 13, 1865.

[[89]edit] Postbellum career

   Averell resigned from the army when peace came and accepted an
   appointment as U.S. [90]consul general to [91]British North America
   (1866–1869). In later life, his skill as an inventor of practical
   devices provided him with a handsome income. Among his inventions were
   methods for manufacturing steel castings and insulated electrical
   cable. He is most famous as the inventor of American asphalt pavement.
   He was the posthumous author of Ten Years in the Saddle (1978) and
   posthumous co-author of History of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, 60th
   Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers (1905).

   General Averell died in [92]Bath, New York, and is buried there.
