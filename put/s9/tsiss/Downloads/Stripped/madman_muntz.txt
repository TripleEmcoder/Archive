   Earl William "Madman" Muntz (January 3, 1914 – June 21, 1987)^[12][1]
   was an American [13]businessman and [14]engineer who sold and promoted
   cars and [15]consumer electronics in the United States from the 1930s
   until his death in 1987. He was a pioneer in [16]television commercials
   with his oddball "Madman" [17]persona – an [18]alter ego who generated
   publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims.
   Muntz also pioneered car stereos^[19][1] by creating the Muntz
   [20]Stereo-Pak, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to
   the [21]8-track cartridge developed by [22]Lear Industries.^[23][2]

   He invented the practice that came to be known as [24]Muntzing, which
   involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices. Muntz
   produced and marketed the first black-and-white television receivers to
   sell for less than $100, and created one of the earliest functional
   [25]widescreen [26]projection TVs.^[27][3] He was credited with coining
   the abbreviation "TV" for television,^[28][4] although the term had
   earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as [29]WCBS-TV. A
   high school [30]dropout,^[31][5] Muntz made fortunes by selling
   automobiles, TV receivers, and car stereos and tapes.^[32][6] A 1968
   Los Angeles Times article noted that in one year he sold $72 million
   worth of cars, that five years later he sold $55 million worth of TV
   receivers, and that in 1967 he sold $30 million worth of car stereos
   and tapes.^[33][1]

   After his success as a used car salesman and with [34]Kaiser-Frazer
   dealerships in [35]Los Angeles and [36]New York City,^[37][1]^[38][7]
   Muntz founded the [39]Muntz Car Company, which made the "[40]Muntz
   Jet", a [41]sports car with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured
   between 1951 and 1953, although fewer than 400 were produced.

   Muntz married seven times.^[42][8] His wives included actress Joan
   Barton (who appeared in [43]Angel and the Badman with [44]John Wayne)
   and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens [45]Finishing
   Schools.^[46][9] [47]Phyllis Diller was among his many girlfriends. He
   was friends with celebrities such as singer [48]Rudy Vallee, comedian
   [49]Jerry Colonna, actor [50]Bert Lahr,^[51][6] television presenter
   [52]Dick Clark, and actor [53]Gene Autry.^[54][8]

[[66]edit] Early career: 1922-1953

   Muntz was fascinated by electronics from an early age. He built his
   first radio at age 8 and built another for his parents' car at
   age 14.^[67][5] During the [68]Great Depression, at age 15, he dropped
   out of [69]Elgin High School to work in his parents' hardware store in
   Elgin, Illinois.^[70][5]

[[71]edit] Car sales

   An example of a matchbook ad for Muntz car lots in the 1950s

   In 1934, Muntz opened his first used car lot, in Elgin, with a $500
   line of credit.^[72][6] He was only 20 years old, and his mother had to
   sign the car-sale papers because legally he was too young to close his
   own deals.^[73][5] During a vacation in [74]California, Muntz
   discovered that used cars sold there for far higher prices; so he moved
   to California at age 26 to open a used car lot in [75]Glendale.^[76][6]
   On a hunch, he purchased 13 brand-new right-hand-drive vehicles to
   resell. These vehicles had been built for customers in Asia, but could
   not be delivered due to [77]World War II. One vehicle was a custom-made
   [78]Lincoln built for [79]Chiang Kai-shek.^[80][10] Local newspapers
   ran stories about the unusual cars, and Muntz sold them all within two
   weeks, still in their original shipping crates.^[81][10] Muntz soon
   opened a second lot in [82]Los Angeles and closed his lot in
   Elgin.^[83][10]

   Muntz rejected the then common opinion that used car salesmen should
   project a staid image.^[84][1] He realized the possibilities of
   generating publicity with odd stunts, and developed a "Madman" persona
   as a result.^[85][10] His flamboyant billboards and oddball television
   and radio commercials soon made him famous. In his used auto
   commercials, he marketed one model as the "daily special"; Muntz
   claimed that if the car did not sell that day, he would smash it to
   pieces on camera with a [86]sledgehammer.^[87][11] Another infamous
   Muntz used-car TV pitch was "I buy 'em retail and sell 'em wholesale
   ... it's more fun that way!"^[88][4] His commercials generated so much
   publicity that comedians such as [89]Bob Hope, [90]Jack Benny, and
   [91]Steve Allen often tried to outdo each other during television
   appearances by telling "Madman" Muntz jokes.^[92][1] [93]University of
   Southern California fans would spell out Muntz's name during halftime
   as a prank.^[94][10]

   Muntz's car lots became tourist attractions due to the widespread
   publicity from his television commercial appearances. A 1946 survey by
   Panner Motor Tours revealed that they ranked seventh among tourist
   attractions in Southern California.^[95][1] Muntz was willing to take
   large risks in his attempts to generate publicity. During the era of
   [96]McCarthyism, he asked one of his advisers, "Do you think I'd make
   the front pages if I joined the Communist Party?"^[97][12]

[[98]edit] Muntz Jet

   Main article: [99]Muntz Car Company

   auction

   In 1948, race car designer and [100]Kurtis-Kraft founder [101]Frank
   Kurtis attempted to market a new [102]sports car, the two-seater Kurtis
   Kraft Sport. Only 36 units had been sold by 1950.^[103][13] In 1951,
   for just $200,000,^[104][14] Kurtis sold the cars' manufacturing
   license to Muntz, who quickly [105]rebadged them as the "Muntz
   Jet".^[106][15] Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale,
   where Muntz extended the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport's body by
   13 inches (33 cm), making it a four-seater, and exchanged the [107]Ford
   V8 engine for a larger [108]Cadillac [109]V8.^[110][14] Later, after
   making just 28 Jets in California, Muntz moved production to a new
   factory in [111]Evanston, [112]Illinois, extended the body further by
   3 inches (8 cm), and replaced the Cadillac V8 with a less expensive
   Lincoln [113]sidevalve V8.

   The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of
   [114]Popular Science along with a [115]Jaguar and an [116]MG.^[117][16]
   It featured its own design, with [118]aluminum body panels and a
   removable [119]fiberglass top.^[120][15] Paint schemes were
   extravagant, with names like "Mars Red", "Stratosphere Blue", and "Lime
   Mist", and interior options included alligator or Spanish
   [121]leatherette. The backseat armrests contained a full cocktail
   bar.^[122][17]

   The Jet was capable of a top speed of 125 miles per hour (201 km/h) and
   acceleration of 0–50 mph (0–80 km/h) in 6 seconds, a significant
   achievement for a road car at the time.^[123][17] The fastest
   production car in 1953 was the [124]Pegaso Z-102 Supercharged sports
   car at 155 miles per hour (249 km/h).^[125][18] Famous Jet owners
   included then-CEO of [126]CBS [127]Frank Stanton,^[128][19] and actors
   [129]Mickey Rooney^[130][5] and [131]Lash La Rue.^[132][17]

   The labor and materials required to produce the Jet resulted in a
   higher price for the end product, and in 1954, after selling about
   400 cars and losing about $1,000 on each, Muntz closed the
   company.^[133][15] Today, Muntz Jets are highly prized collector cars
   and are recognized as predecessors to the [134]Chevrolet Corvette and
   [135]Ford Thunderbird.^[136][17]

[[137]edit] Muntz TV

   Muntz started plans to sell television receivers in 1946,^[138][11] and
   sales began in 1947.^[139][20] Muntz played the madman in his
   unorthodox television commercials, but in fact he was a shrewd
   businessman and a self-taught [140]electrical engineer. By trial and
   error, taking apart and studying [141]Philco, [142]RCA, and [143]DuMont
   televisions, he figured out how to reduce the devices' electrical
   components to their minimum functional number.^[144][21] This practice
   became known as "[145]Muntzing".^[146][11]

   In the 1940s and 1950s, most brands of television receivers were
   complicated pieces of equipment, commonly containing about
   30 [147]vacuum tubes, as well as [148]rheostats, [149]transformers, and
   other heavy components. As a result, they were usually very expensive:
   the cheapest U.S.-manufactured receiver made before World War II used a
   3-inch (8 cm) screen and cost $125, the equivalent of $1,863 in 2007;
   the cheapest model with a 12-inch (30 cm) screen cost $445, equivalent
   to $6,633 in 2007.^[150][22] By 1954, although television had existed
   in various forms for more than 40 years, only 55 percent of U.S.
   households owned a receiver.^[151][23] By contrast, eight years later,
   90 percent of U.S. households had one.^[152][23]
   A 1951 Muntz TV model 17A3A

   Muntz developed a television chassis that produced an acceptable
   [153]monochrome picture with 17 tubes. He often carried a pair of wire
   clippers, and when he thought that one of his employees was
   "over-engineering" a circuit, he would begin snipping components out
   until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would
   tell the engineer "Well, I guess you have to put that last part back
   in" and walk away.^[154][11]

   Marketed under the name "Muntz" by his company Muntz TV,
   Inc.,^[155][10] the simplified units were the first black and white TV
   receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $100.^[156][5] Muntz was
   also the first retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner
   rather than by width.^[157][21] The receivers sold well and were
   reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat. The sets worked
   well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission
   towers where signals were strong. They worked poorly with weaker
   signals, as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended
   to boost performance in fringe areas. This was a calculated decision:
   Muntz preferred to leave the low-volume, high-performance television
   receiver market to firms such as RCA and [158]Zenith Electronics, as
   his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited
   funds.^[159][11] Additionally, many urban apartment buildings had rules
   prohibiting external television aerials, and installation of an aerial,
   even if allowed, cost as much as $150. Muntz solved this problem by
   adding a built-in aerial to his receivers.^[160][24] In 1952, Muntz TV
   Inc. grossed $49.9 million.^[161][10]

   Muntz continued with his "Madman" persona in many of his
   advertisements. In one TV commercial that normally aired after the
   [162]Ed Sullivan Show,^[163][11] Muntz, dressed in red [164]long johns
   and a [165]Napoleon hat, promoted his new 14-inch (36 cm) televisions
   by saying, "I wanna give 'em away, but Mrs. Muntz won't let me. She's
   crazy!"^[166][11] Another TV commercial presented a marching-band song
   with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by [167]Oskar
   Fischinger. His radio commercials, which Muntz ran up to 170 times a
   day, initially followed a classical music theme built around the
   spelling of Muntz's name.^[168][1] However, he soon convinced radio
   stations to run ads more in line with his persona. In one advert, Muntz
   screamed "Stop staring at your radio!"^[169][25] He followed up his
   radio ads with a direct mail campaign, collecting thousands of TV knobs
   and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying, "Call us
   and we'll show up with the rest of the set!"^[170][25]

   Some sources credit Muntz with inventing the abbreviation
   "TV."^[171][4]^[172][5]^[173][26] Muntz used [174]skywriting as one of
   his marketing tactics, but, after watching one of his ads being
   created, he noted that the letters began to blur and dissipate before
   the pilot could finish spelling out "Muntz Televisions". So Muntz came
   up with the abbreviation "TV".^[175][5] However, "TV" had earlier been
   used in the call letters of television stations, such as [176]WCBS-TV,
   which adopted those call letters in 1946.^[177][27] Muntz also named
   his daughter "Tee Vee", although she normally went by "Teena" and,
   later, "Tee".^[178][8]

[[179]edit] Audio and video: 1954-1985

   With the advent of [180]color television by the mid-1950s, the market
   for black-and-white receivers shrank. Muntz's creditors refused to
   provide further financing in 1954.^[181][28] Muntz admitted his
   business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953,^[182][28] and
   although he tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and went out
   of business in 1959.^[183][29] However, Muntz's success continued in
   the sale of cars and general consumer electronics.

[[184]edit] 4-track cartridge

   Main article: [185]Stereo-Pak

   Attempting to combine his two main product lines, cars and stereos,
   Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak [186]4-track tape
   cartridge.^[187][30] 4-track was the direct predecessor of the
   [188]Stereo 8 cartridge, also known as the "8-track", later developed
   by American inventor [189]Bill Lear.^[190][1] The Stereo-Pak cartridge
   was based on the endless-loop [191]Fidelipac cartridge, which was being
   used by radio stations, designed by inventor [192]George Eash. Muntz
   chose [193]stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide
   availability.^[194][29] Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only
   in-car units capable of recorded playback were gramophone-based
   players, such as the [195]Highway Hi-Fi invented by [196]Peter
   Goldmark.^[197][31] These units played special 16 2/3 rpm records or
   [198]45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle
   hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing
   the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.^[199][29]

   Muntz designed a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars and
   had it inexpensively manufactured in Japan.^[200][29] The Autostereo
   could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape
   over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the
   gramophone-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were
   minimized to allow the driver to concentrate on the road.^[201][29] The
   tape player gave customers greater control over their listening
   experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public
   service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts.^[202][29] Muntz sold
   the players and cartridges from his own stores and through
   [203]franchises in Florida and Texas.^[204][29]

   Muntz audio products were so profitable by 1962 that he cancelled his
   agreements with tape-duplicating companies and founded his own company
   to manufacture prerecorded Stereo-Pak cartridges.^[205][2]^[206][29]
   Most record companies did not manufacture Stereo-Pak cartridges
   themselves; however, the [207]Muntz Electronics Corporation licensed
   music from all the major record labels and issued hundreds of different
   tapes in the mid to late 1960s. Muntz exhibited his Autostereo players
   and Stereo-Pak cartridges under the trade name Stereo-Pak at the 1967
   [208]Consumer Electronics Show.^[209][32]
   Muntz Stereo-Pak ads tended to feature attractive young models and
   suggestive tag lines.

   The Autostereo player, which retailed from $129 in 1963, was a popular
   [210]aftermarket addition to cars among the [211]Beverly Hills rich and
   famous.^[212][33] [213]Frank Sinatra used one in his [214]Buick
   Riviera, [215]Dean Martin in his Corvette, and [216]Peter Lawford in
   his [217]Ghia. [218]James Garner, [219]Red Skelton, and [220]Lawrence
   Welk also used Autostereo players in their cars. [221]Barry Goldwater
   purchased one for his son, and [222]Jerry Lewis recorded his scripts
   onto Stereo-Pak cartridges to learn his lines while driving.^[223][33]

   Muntz attempted to establish a modern, trendy image for his players and
   cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed
   in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive
   model with a suggestive tagline. Most of his employees in his
   California shops were attractive young women dressed in overbright
   clothing.^[224][34]

   Bill Lear distributed the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install
   units in his [225]Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to
   re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, the result
   of which became the Stereo 8 system.^[226][29] The market for Muntz's
   4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8,
   which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex
   cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity
   since the tape speed was double the speed of the Stereo 8 system (and
   the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo 8 quickly
   became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late
   1960s. [227]Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo 8 players in
   their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by
   1966.^[228][35]

   In a 1979 interview in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed the
   biggest problem for the Stereo-Pak business was returned
   merchandise.^[229][36] He explained that when reproducing the work of
   major artists like [230]The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make
   hundreds of thousands of cartridges. But once a popular album became
   less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting
   credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and
   said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak
   business unprofitable.^[231][36]

[[232]edit] Home video

   In late 1970, Muntz closed his Stereo-Pak audio business after a fire
   severely damaged his main offices. He then entered the growing
   home-video market. During the mid-1970s, Muntz thought of taking a
   15-inch (38 cm) [233]Sony color [234]cathode ray tube (CRT) television
   receiver, fitting it with a special lens and reflecting mirror, then
   projecting the magnified image onto a larger screen. He housed these
   primitive units in a large wooden [235]console, making it one of the
   first successful widescreen projection TV receivers marketed for home
   use.^[236][3]^[237][37]

   The receivers were built in Muntz's headquarters in [238]Van Nuys,
   California. Sony's U.S. sales division was unaware that Muntz was
   dealing directly with Sony's Tokyo [239]original equipment manufacturer
   (OEM) department, which shipped him the TV chassis directly.^[240][3]
   Thanks to Muntz's talent for mass-market advertising and
   self-promotion, by 1977 the projection receivers were a
   multi-million-dollar business.^[241][3] Muntz was quick to feature
   [242]Sony's [243]Betamax as well as [244]JVC's and [245]RCA's [246]VHS
   recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to demonstrate the
   potential for a "theater experience in the home".^[247][3]

   In 1979, Muntz decided to sell blank tapes and VCRs as [248]loss
   leaders to attract customers to his showroom, where he would then try
   to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through
   the early 1980s^[249][3] until he invested heavily in the
   [250]Technicolor [251]Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4 in (0.6 cm)
   system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the [252]Super 8 film
   home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales
   quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.^[253][3]

[[254]edit] Later years

   Shortly before dying of lung cancer in 1987, Muntz centered his retail
   business on [255]cellular phones, [256]satellite dishes, a
   [257]motorhome rental company dubbed "Muntz Motor Mansions",^[258][38]
   and prefabricated aluminum houses.^[259][8] He made headlines in
   February 1985 as the first retailer to offer a [260]Hitachi cellular
   phone for less than $1,000, when just two years earlier most cellular
   phones had cost about $3,000.^[261][39] At the time of his death, he
   was the leading retailer of cellular phones in Los Angeles.^[262][8]
   During his final years, Muntz drove a customized [263]Lincoln
   Continental with a television installed in the dashboard: Muntz claimed
   it helped him "drive better".^[264][6]

   After he died, his children, James and Tee, continued to operate two
   Muntz stores in [265]Van Nuys and [266]Newhall; the remainder of the
   stores were [267]franchised businesses. James employed his father's
   advertising techniques to create splashy ads featuring prices that
   annoyed his competitors so much that they referred to them as
   "[268]cutthroat".^[269][40]

[[270]edit] Legacy

   The "Madman" method pioneered by Muntz was later copied by other
   retailers, including California car salesman [271]Cal
   Worthington^[272][41] and New York area electronics chain [273]Crazy
   Eddie.^[274][42] In Crazy Eddie TV commercials, radio personality
   [275]Jerry Carroll leapt at the camera and jumped around while
   jabbering at high speed, always ending with the line, "Crazy Eddie: Our
   prices are insaaaaaane!".^[276][43] As a result of his Crazy Eddie
   commercials, Carroll became a significant 80s icon, even appearing in
   the film [277]Splash.^[278][43]

   Muntz' cultural impact was such that he was mentioned in novels,
   including [279]children's book The Neddiad: How Neddie Took The Train,
   Went To Hollywood, And Saved Civilization by [280]Daniel Manus
   Pinkwater,^[281][44] The Lost Get-Back Boogie by [282]James Lee
   Burke,^[283][45] and Franklin Mason's Four Roses in Three Acts
   .^[284][46]

   A production called Madman Muntz: American Maverick was screened at
   film festivals through 2007.^[285][8] Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy
   ver Mehr, it was produced by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz
   Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley
   International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival.^[286][8]
   The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his
   colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and
   home movie footage contributed by his children.^[287][8]

   The [288]KCET 1997 documentary More Things That Aren't Here Anymore has
   a segment on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during
   pledge periods.

   In 2001, Madman Muntz was posthumously inducted into the [289]Consumer
   Electronics Hall of Fame.^[290][47]
