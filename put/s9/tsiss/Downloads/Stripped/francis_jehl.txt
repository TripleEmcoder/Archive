   Occupation [9]Inventor

   Francis Jehl (September 6, 1860 - February 11, 1941) was a laboratory
   assistant of [10]Thomas Edison. Jehl studied chemistry at Cooper Union
   at night. After finishing school at the age of 18, he went to work for
   Edison at [11]Menlo Park. In 1882, Jehl went to Europe to introduce the
   [12]Edison light system in the various European countries. Jehl wrote a
   book titled Reminiscences of Menlo Park based on a diary of his
   experiences at the laboratory.

[[17]edit] History

   Before Jehl worked for Edison he worked for Grosvenor Lowrey, who was
   the chief counsel of [18]Western Union Telegraph Company. When Jehl
   worked for Lowrey he was responsible for making multiple copies of a
   wide range of documents pertaining to Edison's electric pen. Some of
   the other duties that came with Jehl's employment with Lowrey was
   overseeing the care of Bunsen cells which happened to occupy the
   current of the electric pen. This was particularly important.

   In February 1879 Jehl began his employment with Edison at Menlo Park, a
   facility in [19]New Jersey where Edison researched and developed his
   inventions that had only been around for two years when Jehl arrived.
   He was responsible for maintaining 50 or so [20]bunsen cells on a
   variety of tables on the second floor of the laboratory. After the
   completion of Jehl's first assignment, Edison noticed Jehl's work ethic
   and he was so impressed that he gave Jehl a job to work more closely
   with him. Jehl worked on the electric light during the laboratory stage
   of development. Jehl was responsible for performing many experiments
   and tests; however, some of the most important were those that were
   related to the electric meter for the central stations. Edison had
   given Jehl specific instructions to keep him informed daily with the
   tests and experiments that he conducted and the results obtained. With
   the results that Edison received from Jehl, he was able to make
   informed decisions on how to create things, like the thermal regulator
   for the meter.

   In 1882, Jehl and many of his associates went to Europe in order to
   participate in the foreign electrical exhibitions. These exhibitions
   were crucial to the future prospect of international business for the
   Edison Company. During Jehl's stay in Europe in February 1882, he was
   supposed to oversee the introduction of the Edison meter. After Jehl
   helped Edison, he ended up spending forty years in Europe, helping to
   build power plants and electric lighting systems. Jehl later returned
   to the United States after World War I, when he supervised the
   reconstruction of the Menlo Park Laboratory. The reconstruction of the
   Menlo Park laboratory in Greenfield Village was initiated by [21]Henry
   Ford.

   During the two years that Jehl spent at Menlo Park, he kept a personal
   diary. This diary detailed some of the exceptional things that he
   personally witnessed during his employment there. This diary was the
   foundation for Jehl's personal book, titled Reminiscences of Menlo
   Park, which was published fifty years afterwards.

[[22]edit] Death

   Jehl died on February 11, 1941 in [23]St. Petersburg, Florida at the
   age of 80. Jehl was one of the last surviving associates to Thomas
   Edison, whom assisted with the creation of the incandescent light. Jehl
   was survived by his wife, and son Fred Jehl, in [24]Budapest,
   [25]Hungary.
