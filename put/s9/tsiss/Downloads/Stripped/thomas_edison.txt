   Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an
   American inventor, scientist, and businessman who developed many
   devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the
   [17]phonograph, the [18]motion picture camera, and a long-lasting,
   practical electric [19]light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park"
   (now [20]Edison, New Jersey) by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the
   first inventors to apply the principles of [21]mass production and
   large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often
   credited with the creation of the first industrial research
   laboratory.^[22][1]

   Edison is considered one of the most [23]prolific inventors in history,
   holding 1,093 [24]US patents in his name, as well as many patents in
   the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. He is credited with numerous
   inventions that contributed to [25]mass communication and, in
   particular, [26]telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a
   mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical
   power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these
   fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a [27]telegraph
   operator. Edison originated the concept and implementation of
   electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and
   factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world.
   His first [28]power station was on [29]Manhattan Island, New York.

Early life

   Thomas Edison as a boy

   Thomas Edison was born in [57]Milan, Ohio and grew up in [58]Port
   Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden
   Edison, Jr. (1804–96, born in [59]Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, Canada)
   and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871).^[60][2]^[[61]citation needed]
   His father had to escape from Canada because he took part in the
   unsuccessful [62]Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837.^[[63]citation needed]
   Edison considered himself to be of Dutch ancestry.^[64][3] In school,
   the young Edison's mind often wandered, and his teacher, the Reverend
   Engle, was overheard calling him "[65]addled". This ended Edison's
   three months of official schooling. Edison recalled later, "My mother
   was the making of me. She was so true, so sure of me; and I felt I had
   something to live for, someone I must not disappoint." His mother
   homeschooled him.^[66][4] Much of his education came from reading R.G.
   Parker's [67]School of Natural Philosophy and [68]The Cooper Union.
   Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his
   deafness has been attributed to a bout of [69]scarlet fever during
   childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the
   middle of his career Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being
   struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in
   a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in [70]Smiths
   Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later
   years he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the
   conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the
   ears.^[71][5]^[72][6] Edison's family was forced to move to [73]Port
   Huron, Michigan, when the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854,^[74][7] but
   his life there was bittersweet. He sold candy and newspapers on trains
   running from Port Huron to Detroit, and he sold vegetables to
   supplement his income. This began Edison's long streak of
   entrepreneurial ventures as he discovered his talents as a businessman.
   These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including
   [75]General Electric, which is still in existence and is one of the
   largest [76]publicly traded companies in the world.^[77][8]^[78][9]

Telegrapher

   Edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie
   MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father,
   [79]station agent J.U. MacKenzie of [80]Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so
   grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first
   telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction,
   [81]Ontario, on the [82]Grand Trunk Railway.^[83][10] In 1866, at the
   age of 19, Thomas Edison moved to [84]Louisville, Kentucky, where, as
   an employee of [85]Western Union, he worked the [86]Associated Press
   bureau [87]news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed
   him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and
   experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job.
   One night in 1867, he was working with a [88]lead-acid battery when he
   spilled [89]sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the
   floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was
   fired.^[90][11]

   One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher
   and inventor named [91]Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the
   impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his
   [92]Elizabeth, New Jersey home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions
   were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent
   was for the electric vote recorder, (U. S. Patent 90,646),^[93][12]
   which was granted on June 1, 1869.^[94][13]

Marriages and children

   Mina Edison in 1906

   On December 25, 1871, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell, whom he
   had met two months earlier as she was an employee at one of his shops.
   They had three children:
     * Marion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed "Dot"^[95][14]
     * Thomas Alva Edison, Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed "Dash"^[96][15]
     * William Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the
       Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.^[97][16]

   Mary Edison died on August 9, 1884, possibly from a [98]brain
   tumor.^[99][17]

   On February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty nine, Edison married
   20-year-old Mina Miller in [100]Akron, Ohio.^[101][18] She was the
   daughter of inventor [102]Lewis Miller, co-founder of the
   [103]Chautauqua Institution and a benefactor of [104]Methodist
   charities. They also had three children:
     * Madeleine Edison (1888–1979), who married John Eyre
       Sloane.^[105][19]^[106][20]
     * [107]Charles Edison (1890–1969), who took over the company upon his
       father's death and who later was elected [108]Governor of New
       Jersey.^[109][21] He also took charge of his father's experimental
       laboratories in [110]West Orange.
     * [111]Theodore Edison (1898–1992), (MIT Physics 1923), had over 80
       patents to his credit.

   Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24,
   1947.^[112][22]^[113][23]

   Thomas Edison began his career as an inventor in [117]Newark, New
   Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic
   devices, but the invention which first gained him notice was the
   [118]phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the
   public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as
   "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey. His first phonograph recorded
   on [119]tinfoil around a grooved cylinder, but had poor [120]sound
   quality and the recordings could only be played a few times. In the
   1880s, a redesigned model using wax-coated cardboard cylinders was
   produced by [121]Alexander Graham Bell, [122]Chichester Bell, and
   [123]Charles Tainter. This was one reason that Thomas Edison continued
   work on his own "Perfected Phonograph."

Menlo Park (1876–1881)

   Edison's major innovation was the first industrial research lab, which
   was built in [124]Menlo Park, New Jersey. It was built with the funds
   from the sale of Edison's [125]quadruplex telegraph. After his
   demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original
   plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western
   Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer
   $10,000,^[[126]citation needed] which he gratefully accepted. The
   quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and
   Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific
   purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement.
   Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced
   there, though many employees carried out research and development under
   his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions
   in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.

   [127]Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. (Note the organ against
   the back wall)

   [128]William J. Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, began his
   duties as a laboratory assistant to Edison in December 1879. He
   assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway,
   iron ore separator, [129]electric lighting, and other developing
   inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent
   electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that
   device. In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp
   Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager [130]Francis
   Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was
   "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting".

   demonstration at Menlo Park, December 1879

   Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were
   protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes
   that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen
   were [131]design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to
   a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were
   improvements over [132]prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast,
   was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and
   reproduce sounds.^[133][24] Edison did not invent the first electric
   light bulb, but instead invented the first commercially practical
   incandescent light. Many earlier inventors had previously devised
   incandescent lamps including [134]Henry Woodward, and [135]Mathew
   Evans. Others who developed early and not commercially practical
   incandescent electric lamps included [136]Humphry Davy, [137]James
   Bowman Lindsay, [138]Moses G. Farmer,^[139][25] [140]William E. Sawyer,
   [141]Joseph Swan and [142]Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had
   such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and
   high [143]electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a
   large scale commercially. In 1878, Edison applied the term
   [144]filament to the [145]element of glowing wire carrying the current,
   although the English inventor [146]Joseph Swan had used the term prior
   to this. Swan developed an incandescent light with a long lasting
   filament at about the same time as Edison, but it lacked the high
   resistance needed to be an effective part of an electrical utility.
   Edison and his co-workers set about the task of creating longer-lasting
   bulbs. In Britain, Joseph Swan had been able to obtain a patent on the
   incandescent lamp because of an oversight in the drafting of Edison's
   patent application.^[147][26] Unable to raise the required capital in
   Britain because of this, Edison was forced to enter into a joint
   venture with Swan (known as [148]Ediswan). Swan acknowledged that
   Edison had anticipated him, saying "Edison is entitled to more than I
   ... he has seen further into this subject, vastly than I, and foreseen
   and provided for details that I did not comprehend until I saw his
   system".^[149][27] By 1879, Edison had produced a new concept: a high
   resistance lamp in a very high vacuum, which would burn for hundreds of
   hours. While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in
   laboratory conditions, dating back to a demonstration of a glowing wire
   by [150]Alessandro Volta in 1800, Edison concentrated on commercial
   application, and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses
   by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a
   complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.

   In just over a decade Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to
   occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have "a stock
   of almost every conceivable material". A newspaper article printed in
   1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained
   "eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every
   size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses,
   hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture,
   cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise
   shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's
   tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ..." and the list goes on.^[151][28]

   Over his desk, Edison displayed a placard with [152]Sir Joshua
   Reynolds' famous quote: "There is no expedient to which a man will not
   resort to avoid the real labor of thinking."^[153][29] This slogan was
   reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.

   With Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory
   concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.

Carbon telephone transmitter

   In 1877–78, Edison invented and developed the [154]carbon microphone
   used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.
   After protracted patent litigation, in 1892 a federal court ruled that
   Edison—and not [155]Emile Berliner—was the inventor of the carbon
   microphone. The carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting
   and public address work through the 1920s.

Electric light

   Edison in 1878
   Main article: [156]History of the light bulb

   Building on the contributions of other developers over the previous
   three quarters of a century, Edison made significant improvements to
   the idea of [157]incandescent light, and wound up in the public
   consciousness as "the inventor" of the [158]lightbulb.

   After many experiments with [159]platinum and other metal filaments,
   Edison returned to a [160]carbon filament. The first successful test
   was on October 22, 1879;^[161][30] it lasted 40 hours. Edison continued
   to improve this design and by November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent
   223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using "a
   carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact
   wires".^[162][31] Although the patent described several ways of
   creating the carbon filament including "cotton and linen thread, wood
   splints, papers coiled in various ways",^[163][31] it was not until
   several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team
   discovered a [164]carbonized [165]bamboo filament that could last over
   1,200 hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated
   from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo
   fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the
   present-day state of [166]Wyoming, where he and other members of a
   scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total
   eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the [167]Continental
   Divide.^[168][32]
   U.S. Patent#223898: Electric-Lamp. Issued January 27, 1880.

   In 1878, Edison formed the [169]Edison Electric Light Company in New
   York City with several financiers, including [170]J. P. Morgan and the
   members of the [171]Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public
   demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in
   Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: "We will make
   electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles."^[172][33]

   [173]George Westinghouse's company bought [174]Philip Diehl's competing
   [175]induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the
   holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the
   use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric
   lamp.^[176][34]

   On October 8, 1883, the [177]US patent office ruled that Edison's
   patent was based on the work of William Sawyer and was therefore
   invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6,
   1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim
   for "a filament of carbon of high resistance" was valid. To avoid a
   possible court battle with [178]Joseph Swan, whose British patent had
   been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company
   called [179]Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.

   [180]Mahen Theatre in [181]Brno in what is now the Czech Republic, was
   the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps,
   with the installation supervised by Edison's assistant in the invention
   of the lamp, [182]Francis Jehl.^[183][35] In September 2010, a
   sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of
   the theatre.^[184][36]

Electric power distribution

   Edison patented a system for [185]electricity distribution in 1880,
   which was essential to capitalize on the invention of the electric
   lamp. On December 17, 1880, Edison founded the [186]Edison Illuminating
   Company. The company established the first investor-owned electric
   utility in 1882 on [187]Pearl Street Station, New York City. It was on
   September 4, 1882, that Edison switched on his [188]Pearl Street
   generating station's electrical power distribution system, which
   provided 110 volts [189]direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower
   [190]Manhattan.^[191][37]

   Earlier in the year, in January 1882 he had switched on the first steam
   generating power station at [192]Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC
   supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several
   private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January
   19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system
   employing [193]overhead wires began service in [194]Roselle, New
   Jersey.

War of currents

   Main article: [195]War of Currents
   Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of
   public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [196]Tennessee
   Centennial Exposition.

   Edison's true success, like that of his friend [197]Henry Ford, was in
   his ability to maximize profits through establishment of
   mass-production systems and [198]intellectual property rights.
   [199]George Westinghouse and Edison became adversaries because of
   Edison's promotion of [200]direct current (DC) for electric power
   distribution instead of the more easily transmitted [201]alternating
   current (AC) system invented by [202]Nikola Tesla and promoted by
   Westinghouse. Unlike DC, AC could be stepped up to very high voltages
   with [203]transformers, sent over thinner and cheaper wires, and
   stepped down again at the destination for distribution to users.

   In 1887 there were 121 Edison power stations in the United States
   delivering DC electricity to customers. When the limitations of DC were
   discussed by the public, Edison launched a propaganda campaign to
   convince people that AC was far too dangerous to use. The problem with
   DC was that the power plants could economically deliver DC electricity
   only to customers within about one and a half miles (about 2.4 km) from
   the generating station, so that it was suitable only for central
   business districts. When George Westinghouse suggested using
   [204]high-voltage AC instead, as it could carry electricity hundreds of
   miles with marginal loss of power, Edison waged a "[205]War of
   Currents" to prevent AC from being adopted.

   Despite Edison's contempt for [206]capital punishment, the war against
   AC led him to become involved in the development and promotion of the
   [207]electric chair (using AC) as an attempt to portray AC to have
   greater lethal potential than DC. Edison went on to carry out a brief
   but intense campaign to ban the use of AC or to limit the allowable
   voltage for safety purposes. As part of this campaign, Edison's
   employees publicly [208]electrocuted animals to demonstrate the dangers
   of AC;^[209][38]^[210][39] alternating electric currents are slightly
   more dangerous in that frequencies near 60 Hz have a markedly greater
   potential for inducing fatal "cardiac fibrillation" than do direct
   currents.^[211][40] On one of the more notable occasions, in 1903,
   Edison's workers electrocuted [212]Topsy the elephant at Luna Park,
   near [213]Coney Island, after she had killed several men and her owners
   wanted her put to death.^[214][41] His company filmed the
   electrocution.

   AC replaced DC in most instances of generation and power distribution,
   enormously extending the range and improving the efficiency of power
   distribution. Though widespread use of DC ultimately lost favor for
   distribution, it exists today primarily in long-distance
   [215]high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. Low
   voltage DC distribution continued to be used in high-density downtown
   areas for many years but was eventually replaced by AC low-voltage
   network distribution in many of them. DC had the advantage that large
   [216]battery banks could maintain continuous power through brief
   interruptions of the electric supply from generators and the
   [217]transmission system. Utilities such as [218]Commonwealth Edison in
   Chicago had [219]rotary converters or [220]motor-generator sets, which
   could change DC to AC and AC to various frequencies in the early to
   mid-20th century. Utilities supplied rectifiers to convert the low
   voltage AC to DC for such DC loads as elevators, fans and pumps. There
   were still 1,600 DC customers in downtown New York City as of 2005, and
   service was finally discontinued only on November 14, 2007.^[221][42]
   Most [222]subway systems still are powered by direct current.

Fluoroscopy

   Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially
   available [223]fluoroscope, a machine that uses [224]X-rays to take
   [225]radiographs. Until Edison discovered that [226]calcium tungstate
   fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium
   [227]platinocyanide screens originally used by [228]Wilhelm Röntgen,
   the technology was capable of producing only very faint images. The
   fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today,
   despite the fact that Edison himself abandoned the project after nearly
   losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant,
   [229]Clarence Dally. Dally had made himself an enthusiastic human
   guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed
   to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to
   the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said "Don't talk to me about
   X-rays, I am afraid of them."^[230][43]

Work relations

   Photograph of Thomas Edison by Victor Daireaux, Paris, circa 1880s

   [231]Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former [232]naval
   officer, was recruited by [233]Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison
   organization in 1883. One of Sprague's significant contributions to the
   Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical
   methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics,
   analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of
   mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis
   Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric
   lighting system including lamp resistance by a sophisticated analysis
   of [234]Ohm's Law, [235]Joule's Law and economics.^[236][44]

   Another of Edison's assistants was [237]Nikola Tesla, to whom Edison
   promised $50,000 if he succeeded in making improvements to his DC
   generation plants. Several months later, when Tesla had finished the
   work and asked to be paid, Edison said, "When you become a full-fledged
   American you will appreciate an American joke."^[238][45] Tesla
   immediately resigned. With Tesla's salary of $18 per week, the payment
   would have amounted to over 53 years' pay and the amount was equal to
   the initial capital of the company. Tesla resigned when he was refused
   a raise to $25 per week.^[239][46] Although Tesla accepted an
   [240]Edison Medal later in life, this and other negative series of
   events concerning Edison remained with Tesla. The day after Edison
   died, the [241]New York Times contained extensive coverage of Edison's
   life, with the only negative opinion coming from Tesla who was quoted
   as saying:

   "He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived
   in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene. [...] His
   method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be
   covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at
   first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a
   little theory and calculation would have saved him 90% of the labour.
   But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical
   knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and
   practical American sense."

   —Nikola Tesla

   It seems very likely that Tesla's description was accurate, considering
   one of Edison's famous quotes regarding his attempts to make the light
   globe:

   "If I find 10,000 ways something won't work, I haven't failed. I am not
   discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step
   forward".^[242][47]

   —Thomas Edison

   When Edison was a very old man and close to death, he said, in looking
   back, that the biggest mistake he had made was that he never respected
   Tesla or his work.^[243][48]

   There were 28 men recognized as [244]Edison Pioneers.

Media inventions

   The key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from
   years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of
   electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the
   [245]stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. Edison
   patented the sound recording and reproducing phonograph in 1878. Edison
   was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or
   "Kinetograph". He did the electromechanical design, while his employee
   [246]W.K.L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and
   optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to
   Dickson.^[247][30] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a [248]Kinetoscope, or
   peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where
   people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope
   were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.^[249][49]

   On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph. In
   April 1896, [250]Thomas Armat's [251]Vitascope, manufactured by the
   Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project
   motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later he
   exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings,
   mechanically synchronized with the film.

   The June 1894 Leonard–Cushing bout. Each of the six one-minute rounds
   recorded by the Kinetoscope was made available to exhibitors for
   $22.50.^[253][50] Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard
   score a knockdown.

   Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American
   Businessman [254]Irving T. Bush (1869–1948) bought from the Continental
   Commerce Company of Franck Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Bachus a dozen
   machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in
   London. At the same time the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel
   et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the
   last three months of 1894 The Continental Commerce Company sold
   hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In
   Germany and in [255]Austria-Hungary the kinetoscope was introduced by
   the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by
   the Ludwig Stollwerck^[256][51] of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik
   Stollwerck & Co of Cologne. The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium
   at the [257]Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kinétoscope Français, a
   Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the
   rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French
   colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian
   industrialists. On May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kinétoscope Belge was
   founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living
   in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in
   starting this business. He had contacts with [258]Leon Gaumont and the
   [259]American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898 he also became a
   shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.^[260][52]

   In 1901, he visited the [261]Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada, as a
   mining prospector, and is credited with the original discovery of the
   [262]Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to actually mine the ore body
   were not successful, however, and he abandoned his mining claim in
   1903.^[263][53] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [264]Edison
   Building, which served as the head office of [265]Falconbridge Mines,
   are named for him.

   In 1902, agents of Thomas Edison bribed a theater owner in London for a
   copy of [266]A Trip to the Moon by [267]Georges Méliès. Edison then
   made hundreds of copies and showed them in New York City. Méliès
   received no compensation. He was counting on taking the film to the US
   and recapture its huge cost by showing it throughout the country when
   he realized it had already been shown there by Edison. This effectively
   bankrupted Méliès.^[268][54] Other exhibitors similarly routinely
   copied and exhibited each others films.^[269][55] To better protect the
   copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips
   of [270]photographic paper with the [271]U.S. copyright office. Many of
   these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the
   actual films of that era.^[272][56]

   Edison's favourite movie was [273]The Birth of a Nation. He thought
   that talkies had "spoiled everything" for him. "There isn't any good
   acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have
   forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am
   deaf."^[274][57] His favorite stars were [275]Mary Pickford and
   [276]Clara Bow.^[277][58]

   In 1908, Edison started the [278]Motion Picture Patents Company, which
   was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the
   Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the
   [279]Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.

West Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931)

   Thomas A. Edison Industries Exhibit, Primary Battery section, 1915
   Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, [280]Harvey Firestone. [281]Ft. Myers,
   Florida, February 11, 1929.

   Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of Mary Stilwell and
   purchased a home known as "[282]Glenmont" in 1886 as a wedding gift for
   Mina in [283]Llewellyn Park in [284]West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885,
   Thomas Edison bought property in [285]Fort Myers, Florida, and built
   what was later called [286]Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. Edison
   and his wife Mina spent many winters in Fort Myers where they recreated
   and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural [287]rubber.

   [288]Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet
   away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers, Florida. Edison
   even contributed technology to the automobile. They were friends until
   Edison's death.

   In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [289]Civitan Club. He believed
   strongly in the organization, writing that "The Civitan Club is doing
   things —big things— for the community, state, and nation, and I
   certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks."^[290][59]
   He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing
   Henry Ford to the club's meetings.

The final years

   Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before
   his death in 1931, the [291]Lackawanna Railroad implemented electric
   trains in suburban service from [292]Hoboken to [293]Gladstone,
   [294]Montclair and [295]Dover in New Jersey. Transmission was by means
   of an overhead catenary system, with the entire project under Edison's
   guidance. To the surprise of many, he was at the throttle of the very
   first MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in
   Hoboken, driving the train all the way to Dover. As another tribute to
   his lasting legacy, the same fleet of cars Edison deployed on the
   Lackawanna in 1931 served commuters until their retirement in 1984,
   when some of them were purchased by the [296]Berkshire Scenic Railway
   Museum in [297]Lenox, Massachusetts. A special plaque commemorating the
   joint achievement of both the railway and Edison can be seen today in
   the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, presently operated
   by [298]New Jersey Transit.^[299][60]

   Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular [300]fad diet in
   his last few years; "the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk
   every three hours".^[301][30] He is reported to have believed this diet
   would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the
   year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him that
   "Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies." She also said that
   during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would
   be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or
   dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.^[302][57]

   Edison became the owner of his [303]Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On
   his last visit, in 1923, he was shocked to find his old home still lit
   by lamps and candles.

   Thomas Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in
   his home, "Glenmont" in [304]Llewellyn Park in [305]West Orange, New
   Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. He
   is buried behind the home.^[306][61]^[307][62]

   Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the
   [308]Henry Ford Museum. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to
   seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death,
   as a memento. A plaster [309]death mask was also made.^[310][63]

   Mina died in 1947.

Views on politics, religion and metaphysics

   Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a
   "[311]freethinker".^[312][30] Edison was heavily influenced by
   [313]Thomas Paine's [314]The Age of Reason.^[315][30] Edison defended
   Paine's "scientific [316]deism", saying, "He has been called an
   [317]atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme
   intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by
   the name of deity."^[318][30] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the
   [319]New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:

     Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And
     nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me — the
     fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness,
     love — He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His
     mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made
     us — nature did it all — not the gods of the religions.^[320][64]

   Edison was called an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not
   allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified
   himself in a private letter: "You have misunderstood the whole article,
   because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of
   God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the
   Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that
   it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever
   one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again
   from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are
   made."^[321][30]

   Nonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as
   a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on
   defensive weapons and later noted, "I am proud of the fact that I never
   invented weapons to kill." Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended
   to animals as well, about which he stated: "Nonviolence leads to the
   highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop
   harming all other living beings, we are still savages."^[322][65]
   However, he is also notorious for having electrocuted a number of dogs
   in 1888, both by direct and alternating current, in an attempt to argue
   that the former (which he had a vested business interest in promoting)
   was safer than the latter (favored by his rival [323]George
   Westinghouse).^[324][66] Edison's success in promoting direct current
   as less lethal also led to alternating current being used in the
   electric chair [325]adopted by New York in 1889 as a supposedly humane
   execution method; because Westinghouse was angered by the decision, he
   funded [326]Eighth Amendment-based appeals for inmates set to die in
   the electric chair, ultimately resulting in Edison providing the
   generators which powered early electrocutions and testifying
   successfully on behalf of the state that electrocution was a painless
   method of execution.^[327][67]

Tributes

Places named for Edison

   Several places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of
   [328]Edison, New Jersey. [329]Thomas Edison State College, a nationally
   known college for adult learners, is in [330]Trenton, New Jersey. Two
   community colleges are named for him: [331]Edison State College in Fort
   Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in [332]Piqua,
   Ohio.^[333][68] There are numerous high schools named after Edison; see
   [334]Edison High School.

   The City Hotel, in [335]Sunbury, Pennsylvania, was the first building
   to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was re-named The
   Hotel Edison, and retains that name today.

   Three bridges around the United States have been named in his honor
   (see [336]Edison Bridge).

Museums and memorials

   In West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acre (5.5 ha) Glenmont estate is
   maintained and operated by the [337]National Park Service as the
   [338]Edison National Historic Site.^[339][69] The [340]Thomas Alva
   Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New
   Jersey.^[341][70] In [342]Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum,
   though Edison never visited there.^[[343]citation needed] The [344]Port
   Huron Museum, in [345]Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot
   that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young [346]newsbutcher. The depot
   has been named the [347]Thomas Edison Depot Museum.^[348][71] The town
   has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's
   parents, and a monument along the [349]St. Clair River. Edison's
   influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000. In Detroit, the
   Edison Memorial Fountain in [350]Grand Circus Park was created to honor
   his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21,
   1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the
   lightbulb.^[351][72] On the same night, [352]The Edison Institute was
   dedicated in nearby [353]Dearborn.

   In early 2010, Edison was proposed by the [354]Ohio Historical Society
   as a finalist in a statewide vote for inclusion in [355]Statuary Hall
   at the [356]United States Capitol.

Awards named in honor of Edison

   The [376]Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of
   Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the [377]American
   Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later [378]IEEE, entered into
   an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award.
   The first medal was presented in 1909 to [379]Elihu Thomson and, in a
   twist of fate, was awarded to [380]Nikola Tesla in 1917. It is the
   oldest award in the area of [381]electrical and electronics
   engineering, and is presented annually "for a career of meritorious
   achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the
   electrical arts."

   In the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the [382]Edison
   Award after him.

   The [383]American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the
   [384]Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since
   2000.^[385][73]

Honors and awards given to Edison

   The [386]President of the [387]Third French Republic, [388]Jules Grévy,
   on the recommendation of his [389]Minister of Foreign Affairs
   [390]Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire and with the presentations of the
   [391]Minister of Posts and Telegraphs [392]Louis Cochery, designated
   Edison with the [393]distinction of an '[394]Officer of the Legion of
   Honour' ([395]Légion d'honneur) by decree on November 10,
   1881;^[396][74]

   In 1983, the [397]United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint
   Resolution 140 (Public Law 97—198), designated February 11, Edison's
   birthday, as National [398]Inventor's Day.

   In 1887, Edison won the [399]Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a
   member of the [400]Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

   In 1889, Edison was awarded the [401]John Scott Medal.

   In 1899, Edison was awarded the [402]Edward Longstreth Medal.

   Edison was awarded [403]Franklin Medal of [404]The Franklin Institute
   in 1915 for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries
   and the well-being of the human race.

   Edison was ranked thirty-fifth on [405]Michael H. Hart's 1978 book
   [406]The 100, a list of the most influential figures in history.
   [407]Life magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed
   Edison first in the list of the "100 Most Important People in the Last
   1000 Years", noting that the [408]light bulb he promoted "lit up the
   world". In the 2005 television series [409]The Greatest American, he
   was voted by viewers as the fifteenth-greatest.

   In 2008, Edison was inducted in the [410]New Jersey Hall of Fame.

Other items named after Edison

   The [411]United States Navy named the [412]USS Edison (DD-439), a
   [413]Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was
   decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II. In 1962, the
   Navy commissioned [414]USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet
   ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine. Decommissioned on December
   1, 1983, Thomas A. Edison was stricken from the [415]Naval Vessel
   Register on April 30, 1986. She went through the Navy's [416]Nuclear
   Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at [417]Bremerton,
   [418]Washington, beginning on October 1, 1996. When she finished the
   program on December 1, 1997, she ceased to exist as a complete ship and
   was listed as scrapped.

In popular culture

   Main article: [419]Thomas Edison in popular culture

   Thomas Edison has appeared in [420]popular culture as a character in
   novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped
   make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during
   his lifetime down to the present day. His history with [421]Nikola
   Tesla has also provided dramatic tension and is a theme returned to
   numerous times.
