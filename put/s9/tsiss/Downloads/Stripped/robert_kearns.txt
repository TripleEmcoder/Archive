        Born      Robert William Kearns
                  March 10, 1927(1927-03-10)
                  [8]Gary, Indiana

                  [9]Baltimore, [10]Maryland
    Nationality   [11]American
   [12]Alma mater [13]Case Western Reserve University
     Occupation   Inventor
     Known for    inventing the intermittent windshield wiper

   Robert William Kearns (March 10, 1927 – February 9, 2005) was the
   [14]inventor of the intermittent [15]windshield wiper systems used on
   most [16]automobiles from 1969 to the present. His first patent for the
   invention was filed on December 1, 1964.

   Kearns won one of the best known [17]patent infringement cases against
   [18]Ford Motor Company (1978–1990) and a case against [19]Chrysler
   Corporation (1982–1992). Having invented and patented the intermittent
   windshield wiper mechanism, which was useful in light rain or mist, he
   tried to interest the "[20]Big Three" auto makers in [21]licensing the
   technology. They all rejected his proposal, yet began to install
   intermittent wipers in their cars, beginning in 1969.

[[34]edit] Early career

   Kearns was born in [35]Gary, Indiana. He grew up near the large Ford
   plant in [36]River Rouge, Michigan, a city south of [37]Detroit. His
   father worked for the Great Lakes Steel Corporation.

   He excelled in cross-country foot racing during high school, was a
   talented violinist, and became a teenage intelligence officer when he
   served in the armed services. Kearns was a member of the [38]Office of
   Strategic Services, the forerunner of the U.S. [39]CIA, during
   [40]World War II.^[41][1]^[42][2]^[43][3]

   He earned [44]engineering degrees from the [45]University of Detroit
   Mercy and [46]Wayne State University and a doctorate from [47]Case
   Western Reserve University.^[48][4]

[[49]edit] Intermittent wipers

   It is reported that the inspiration for his invention stems from an
   incident on Kearns' wedding night in 1953, when an errant [50]champagne
   [51]cork shot into his left eye, which left him legally blind in his
   left eye. Nearly a decade later in 1963 Kearns was driving his [52]Ford
   Galaxie through a light rain, and the constant movement of the wiper
   blades irritated his already troubled vision. He modeled his mechanism
   on the human eye, which blinks every few seconds, rather than
   continuously.^[53][5] Kearns later downplayed his courtroom story of
   the inspiration and played up a more conscious, deliberate inventive
   process.^[54][6]

[[55]edit] Legal case

   He sued [56]Ford Motor Company in 1978 and [57]Chrysler Corporation in
   1982 for patent infringement. The Ford case went to trial in 1990. Ford
   lost, although the court held that Ford's infringement was not willful
   (meaning that damages for infringement would not be enhanced). Ford
   agreed to settle with Kearns for [58]US$ 10.1 million with an agreement
   of no further appeals.

   After the settlement with Ford, Kearns mostly [59]acted as his own
   attorney in the subsequent suit against Chrysler, even questioning
   witnesses on the stand. The Chrysler verdict was decided in 1992, and
   was a victory for Kearns. Chrysler was ordered to pay Kearns [60]US$
   18.7 million with interest.^[61][7] Chrysler appealed the court
   decision, but the [62]Federal Circuit let the judgment stand.^[63][8]
   The [64]Supreme Court declined to hear the case.^[65][9] By 1995, after
   spending over [66]US$ 10 million in legal fees,^[67][10] Kearns
   received approximately [68]US$ 30 million in compensation for
   Chrysler's patent infringement.^[69][7]

   Chrysler was represented by Harness Dickey and Pierce, one of the first
   firms Kearns went to when he contemplated suing Ford in the late 1970s.
   Indeed, according to his son Dennis Kearns, Kearns wanted Harness
   Dickey removed for conflict of interest, but was unable to convince his
   attorneys to make a motion to remove Harness Dickey. He then decided to
   manage the Chrysler litigation on his own with his family. However,
   this strategy did not seem to work out well in subsequent litigation
   against GM, Mercedes, and Japanese companies as he missed deadlines for
   filing papers and his cases were dismissed.^[70][11]

[[71]edit] Auto industry's legal argument

   The legal argument that the auto industry posed in defense was that an
   invention is supposed to meet certain standards of originality and
   novelty. One of these is that it be "[72]non-obvious". Ford had claimed
   that the patent was invalid because Kearns' intermittent windshield
   wiper system had no new components. Kearns noted that his invention was
   a novel and non-obvious combination of parts.^[73][12]^[74][13] Kearns'
   position found unequivocal support in precedent from the U.S. Court of
   Appeals and from the Supreme Court of the United States. See, e.g.,
   Reiner v. I. Leon Co., 285 F.2d 501, 503 (2d Cir. 1960) (“It is idle to
   say that combinations of old elements cannot be inventions;
   substantially every invention is for such a ‘combination’: that is to
   say, it consists of former elements in a new assemblage.”) (Hand., J.)
   (cited with approval in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398
   (2007)).

[[75]edit] Late career

   In the late 1990s, he served on the board of directors of the Veterans
   of the Office of Strategic Services and the General [76]William J.
   Donovan Memorial Fund.^[77][14]

[[78]edit] Death

   On February 9, 2005, Kearns died of [79]brain cancer complicated by
   [80]Alzheimer's disease in [81]Baltimore, [82]Maryland. The story of
   his invention and the lawsuit against Ford forms the basis of the 2008
   film, [83]Flash of Genius. Kearns and his wife Phyllis were divorced.
   According to the movie, Phyllis left Robert due to the stress of the
   court case. They had two daughters, four sons, and, at the time of his
   death, seven grandchildren.^[84][4]
