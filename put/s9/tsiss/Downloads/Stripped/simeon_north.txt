   Simeon North
   Born July 13, 1765
   Died August 25, 1852(1852-08-25) (aged 87)

   Simeon North (July 13, 1765–August 25, 1852) was a [7]Middletown,
   Connecticut gun manufacturer, who developed one of America's first
   [8]milling machines (possibly the very first) in 1818 and played an
   important role in the development of [9]interchangeable parts
   manufacturing.

   North was born in Berlin, Connecticut to a prosperous family, able to
   provide all six sons with farms of their own. North was given a farm in
   [10]Berlin, a gift that enabled him to marry Lucy Savage when he was
   only twenty-one. The couple would have five sons and three daughters.
   In 1795 the Norths purchased a sawmill located on the brook that ran
   beside their land. He hired a man to help run it, enlarged the building
   to house a forge and trip-hammer, and began manufacturing scythes from
   imported steel. Four years later, he obtained a contract to make
   pistols and began to add a factory to the mill building.

   North's brother-in-law, [11]Elisha Cheney was skilled clockmaker, a
   trade he had learned from his father [12]Benjamin Cheney and uncle
   [13]Timothy Cheney, two of the finest clockmakers in Connecticut. In
   1810 Elisha Cheney moved his clock-making shop to the next waterpower
   site upstream from North. Although Cheney was trained as a maker of
   fine clocks in brass and other methods, [14]Eli Terry, a clockmaker who
   had trained as a clockmaker with either Timothy or Benjamin Cheney, had
   just invented a method of mass-producing the parts for wooden shelf, or
   pillar-and-scroll clocks that enabled them to be mass-produced using
   interchangeable parts. Cheney used his new plant to mass-produce parts
   that manufacturers were turning out in emulation of Eli Terry's
   innovation. Cheney is known to have also produced screws and small
   metal parts in his mill for the pistols his Simeon North was
   manufacturing just downstream.

   North is now generally credited with the invention of the milling
   machine—the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and
   the machine that, by replacing filing, made interchangeable parts
   practical.

   By 1813, North had signed a government contract to produce 20,000
   pistols that specified that parts of the lock had to be completely
   interchangeable between any of the 20,000 locks—the first such contract
   of which any such evidence exists. It is during this period that North
   is believed to have invented a milling machine-the first entirely new
   type of machine invented in America and the machine that was able to
   shape metal mechanically and that, by replacing filing, made
   [15]interchangeable parts practical. Historian [16]Diana Muir believes
   that he accomplished this around 1816. According to Muir's book
   [17]Reflections in Bullough's Pond, North "was the first arms maker to
   implement a number of machine production techniques, yet he cautiously
   halted his pursuit of mass-produced, [18]interchangeable parts"
   whenever it became apparent that it was uneconomic. For some time,
   [19]interchangeable parts manufacturing in metal would continue to be a
   combination of machine-made parts and human skill in filling
   machine-parts parts to precise size for such high-end uses as military
   weapons where [20]interchangeable parts were worth paying for at high
   prices. (They were worth it because an army on campaign could
   cannibalize damaged weapons for parts.)

   As North's business grew, he moved it from Berlin to nearby Middletown.

   At about that time, North was sent to [21]Captain John H. Hall,
   superintendent at [22]Harpers Ferry (Va.) Armory^[[23]citation needed],
   to introduce his methods of achieving interchangeability. In 1828,
   North received a contract to produce 5,000 Hall rifles with parts
   interchangeable with those produced at Harpers Ferry. North had a
   53-year contractual relationship with the War Dept. The report of
   Charles H. Fitch prepared for the 1880 Census^[24][1] credits North
   with a key role in developing manufacture with [25]interchangeable
   parts.
