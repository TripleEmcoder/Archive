   Alexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was an eminent
   [21]scientist, [22]inventor, [23]engineer and [24]innovator who is
   credited with inventing the first practical [25]telephone.

   Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with
   work on [26]elocution and [27]speech, and both his mother and wife were
   deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.^[28][1] His research
   on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing
   devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first
   [29]U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876.^[30][N 1] In retrospect,
   Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work
   as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.^[31][3]

   Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including
   groundbreaking work in [32]optical telecommunications, [33]hydrofoils
   and [34]aeronautics. In 1888, Alexander Graham Bell became one of the
   founding members of the [35]National Geographic Society.^[36][4]

Early years

   Alexander Bell was born in [63]Edinburgh, Scotland on March 3,
   1847.^[64][5] The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and now
   has a commemorative marker at the doorstep, marking it as Alexander
   Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell
   (1845–1870) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–1867). Both of his brothers
   died of [65]tuberculosis.^[66][6] His father was Professor
   [67]Alexander Melville Bell, and his mother was Eliza Grace (née
   Symonds).^[68][N 2] Although he was born "Alexander", at age 10, he
   made a plea to his father to have a [69]middle name like his two
   brothers.^[70][7]^[71][N 3] For his 11th birthday, his father
   acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name "Graham", chosen
   out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his
   father and boarder who had become a family friend.^[72][8] To close
   relatives and friends he remained "Aleck" which his father continued to
   call him into later life.^[73][9]

First invention

   As a child, young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his
   world, resulting in gathering [74]botanical specimens as well as
   [75]experimenting even at an early age. His [76]best friend was Ben
   Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour [77]mill, the scene
   of many forays. Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the mill.
   He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at
   the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating
   paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine
   that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of
   years.^[78][10] In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a
   small workshop within which to "invent".^[79][10]

   From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for
   art, poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal
   training, he mastered the [80]piano and became the family's
   pianist.^[81][11] Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he
   reveled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to [82]ventriloquism that
   continually entertained family guests during their occasional
   visits.^[83][11] Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual
   deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a
   manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently
   the conversations swirling around the family parlour.^[84][12] He also
   developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly
   into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable
   clarity.^[85][13] Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led
   him to study [86]acoustics.

   His family was long associated with the teaching of [87]elocution: his
   grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [88]Dublin, and
   his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published
   a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well
   known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist (1860),^[89][11] which
   appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in
   168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the
   United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods
   of how to instruct [90]deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to
   articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher
   meaning. Aleck's father taught him and his brothers not only to write
   [91]Visible Speech but also to identify any symbol and its accompanying
   sound.^[92][14] Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his
   father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his
   abilities in deciphering [93]Latin, [94]Gaelic and even [95]Sanskrit
   symbols.^[96][14]

Education

   As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling
   at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at
   the [98]Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age
   15, completing only the first four forms.^[99][15] His school record
   was undistinguished, marked by [100]absenteeism and lacklustre grades.
   His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while
   he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of
   his demanding father.^[101][16] Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to
   London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he
   spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long
   hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great
   efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with
   conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a
   teacher himself.^[102][17] At age 16, Bell secured a position as a
   "pupil-teacher" of [103]elocution and music, in Weston House Academy,
   at [104]Elgin, Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student
   in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board
   and £10 per session.^[105][18] The following year, he attended the
   [106]University of Edinburgh; joining his older brother Melville who
   had enrolled there the previous year.

First experiments with sound

   Bell's father encouraged Aleck's interest in speech and, in 1863, took
   his sons to see a unique [108]automaton, developed by Sir [109]Charles
   Wheatstone based on the earlier work of [110]Baron Wolfgang von
   Kempelen.^[111][19] The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a
   [112]human voice. Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he
   obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had
   laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built
   their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their
   project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with
   the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.^[113][19]
   While his brother constructed the [114]throat and [115]larynx, Aleck
   tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His
   efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak",
   albeit only a few words.^[116][19] The boys would carefully adjust the
   "lips" and when a [117]bellows forced air through the [118]windpipe, a
   very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came
   to see the Bell invention.^[119][20]

   Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment
   with a live subject, the family's [120]Skye Terrier,
   "Trouve".^[121][21] After he taught it to growl continuously, Aleck
   would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [122]vocal
   cords to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma." With little
   convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you
   grandma?" More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments
   convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog."^[123][22] However,
   these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to
   undertake his first serious work on the transmission of [124]sound,
   using [125]tuning forks to explore [126]resonance. At the age of 19, he
   wrote a report on his work and sent it to [127]philologist
   [128]Alexander Ellis, a colleague of his father (who would later be
   portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in [129]Pygmalion).^[130][22]
   Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were
   similar to existing work in Germany. Dismayed to find that
   groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by [131]Hermann von
   Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning
   fork "[132]contraption", he pored over the German scientist's book,
   Sensations of Tone. Working from his own errant mistranslation of the
   original German edition, Aleck fortuitously then made a deduction that
   would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound,
   reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me
   that if [133]vowel sounds could be produced by [134]electrical means so
   could [135]consonants, so could [136]articulate speech", and also later
   remarking: "I thought that Helmhotz had done it ... and that my failure
   was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder
   ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have
   commenced my experiments!"^[137][23]^[138][24]

Family tragedy

   In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,^[139][25] Bell returned
   to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours,
   continued experiments on sound using a minimum of [140]laboratory
   equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to
   convey sound and later installed a [141]telegraph wire from his room in
   Somerset College to that of a friend.^[142][26] Throughout late 1867,
   his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother,
   Edward "Ted," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from
   [143]tuberculosis. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself
   in correspondence as "A.G. Bell") and served the next year as an
   instructor at [144]Somerset College, [145]Bath, [146]Somerset, England,
   his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon
   his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother,
   Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree
   at the [147]University College London, Bell considered his next years
   as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at
   his family's residence to studying.

   Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures
   brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's [148]private school for the deaf in
   [149]South Kensington, London. His first two pupils were "deaf mute"
   girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older
   brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his
   own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and
   starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870,
   Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family
   crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in
   life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in
   [150]Newfoundland. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move
   when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting
   decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale
   of all the family property,^[151][27] ^[152][N 4] conclude all of his
   brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced
   lisp),^[153][28] and join his father and mother in setting out for the
   "[154]New World".^[155][29] Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a
   relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, he had surmised, was not
   prepared to leave England with him.^[156][29]

Canada

   In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret
   Ottaway),^[157][30] and his parents travelled on the SS Nestorian to
   Canada.^[158][31] After landing at [159]Quebec City, the Bells boarded
   a train to [160]Montreal and later to [161]Paris, Ontario to stay with
   the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with
   the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of 10.5 acres (42,000
   m^2) at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near
   [162]Brantford, [163]Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard,
   large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house and a carriage house, which
   bordered the [164]Grand River.^[165][32]^[166][N 5]

   At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted
   [167]carriage house^[168][33] near to what he called his "dreaming
   place", a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property
   above the river.^[169][34] Despite his frail condition upon arriving in
   Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly
   improved.^[170][35]^[171][N 6] He continued his interest in the study
   of the human voice and when he discovered the [172]Six Nations Reserve
   across the river at [173]Onondaga, he learned the [174]Mohawk language
   and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols.
   For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and
   participated in a ceremony where he donned a [175]Mohawk headdress and
   danced traditional dances.^[176][36]^[177][N 7]

   After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on
   Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound.^[178][33] He designed a
   [179]piano, which, by means of electricity, could transmit its music at
   a distance. Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father
   made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied
   his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach
   his System of Visible Speech.

Work with the deaf

   for Deaf Children

   Subsequently, his father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the
   [181]Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public
   [182]Horace Mann School for the Deaf),^[183][37] in [184]Boston,
   [185]Massachusetts, United States, to introduce the Visible Speech
   System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined
   the post, in favor of his son. Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell
   proved successful in training the school's instructors.^[186][38] He
   was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the [187]American
   Asylum for Deaf-mutes in [188]Hartford, [189]Connecticut and the
   [190]Clarke School for the Deaf in [191]Northampton, Massachusetts.

   Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his
   experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".^[192][39] ^[193][N 8] The
   basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through
   a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but
   work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.^[194][40] Unsure
   of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete
   his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.^[195][41]
   His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting
   [196]Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the president of the Clarke School for
   the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October
   1872 Alexander Bell opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and
   Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf
   pupils with his first class numbering 30 students.^[197][42]^[198][43]
   While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils
   was [199]Helen Keller, who came to him as a young child unable to see,
   hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to
   the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and
   estranges."^[200][44]

   Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness
   as something that ought to be eradicated, and also believed that with
   resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the
   use of [201]sign language, thus enabling their integration within the
   wider society from which many were often being excluded.^[202][45]
   However in several schools children were mistreated, for example by
   having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not
   communicate by signing —the only language they knew— and were therefore
   forced to attempt oral communication.

Continuing experimentation

   In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and
   Elocution at the [203]Boston University School of Oratory. During this
   period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in
   his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was "swept up" by the
   excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in
   the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a
   way to transmit [204]musical notes and articulate speech, but although
   absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough
   time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his
   teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the
   night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his
   [205]boarding house. Keeping up "[206]night owl" hours, he worried that
   his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his
   notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table
   where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking
   cover.^[207][46] Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered
   severe headaches.^[208][40] Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made
   a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.

   Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell only
   retained two students, six-year old "Georgie" Sanders, deaf from birth
   and 15-year old [209]Mabel Hubbard. Each pupil would serve to play an
   important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas
   Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay at nearby
   [210]Salem with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to
   "experiment". Although the offer was made by George's mother and
   followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse
   had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that
   Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher
   and student to continue their work together with free room and board
   thrown in.^[211][47] Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten
   years his junior but became the object of Bell's affection. Losing her
   hearing after a near-fatal bout of [212]scarlet fever close to her
   fifth birthday,^[213][48]^[214][49]^[215][N 9] she had learned to
   [216]read lips but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's
   [217]benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with
   her teacher.^[218][50]

Telephone

   Main article: [219]Invention of the telephone

   By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a
   formative stage with progress it made both at his new Boston
   "laboratory" (a rented facility) as well as at his family home in
   Canada a big success.^[220][N 10] While working that summer in
   Brantford, Bell experimented with a "[221]phonautograph", a pen-like
   machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on [222]smoked glass by
   tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate
   undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound
   waves.^[223][51] Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to
   different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the
   undulatory currents back into sound. But he had no working model to
   demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.^[224][52]

   In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the
   words of [225]Western Union President William Orton, had become "the
   nervous system of commerce". Orton had contracted with inventors
   [226]Thomas Edison and [227]Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple
   [228]telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost
   of constructing new lines.^[229][53] When Bell mentioned to Gardiner
   Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending
   multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two
   wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's
   experiments.^[230][54] Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's
   [231]patent attorney, [232]Anthony Pollok.^[233][55]

   In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist [234]Joseph
   Henry, who was then director of the [235]Smithsonian Institution, and
   asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell
   hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that
   Bell had "the germ of a great invention". When Bell said that he did
   not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, "Get it!" That
   declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did
   not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the
   ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance
   meeting in 1874 between Bell and [236]Thomas A. Watson, an experienced
   electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of
   Charles Williams, changed all that.

   With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell was able to hire
   Thomas Watson as his assistant and the two of them experimented with
   [237]acoustic telegraphy. On 2 June 1875, Watson accidentally plucked
   one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the
   overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for
   transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or
   armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the
   "[238]gallows" [239]sound-powered telephone, which was able to transmit
   indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

The race to the patent office

   Main article: [240]Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy

   In 1875, Bell developed an [241]acoustic telegraph and drew up a
   [242]patent application for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S.
   profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell
   requested that an associate in Ontario, [243]George Brown, attempt to
   patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in
   the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would
   issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented
   elsewhere).^[244][56]

   Meanwhile, [246]Elisha Gray was also experimenting with acoustic
   telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water
   transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [247]caveat with the
   U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water
   transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application
   with the [248]patent office. There is considerable debate about who
   arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent.
   Bell was in Boston on February 14, 1876.

   Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the
   [249]U.S. Patent Office. Bell's patent covered "the method of, and
   apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ...
   by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of
   the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound"^[250][58] ^[251][N
   11]

   Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work,
   drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent
   caveat.

   On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell
   succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter
   similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to
   vibrate in the water, varying the [252]electrical resistance in the
   circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr Watson—Come here—I
   want to see you" into the liquid transmitter,^[253][59] Watson,
   listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words
   clearly.^[254][60]

   Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from
   Gray,^[255][61] Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after
   Bell's patent was granted and only as a [256]proof of concept
   scientific experiment^[257][62] to prove to his own satisfaction that
   intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically
   transmitted.^[258][63] After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the
   electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in
   public demonstrations or commercial use.^[259][64]

   The [260]patent examiner, Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in a sworn
   affidavit^[[261]citation needed]that he was an alcoholic who was much
   in debt to Bell's lawyer, [262]Marcellus Bailey, with whom he had
   served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to
   Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from
   Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him
   $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms,
   although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the
   technical details. Bell denied in a sworn affidavit that he ever gave
   Wilber any money.

Later developments

   Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working
   model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in
   [263]Mount Pleasant five miles (8 km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a
   tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers
   packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying.
   The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a
   message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six
   km) distant along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines
   and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the
   household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing.
   These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over
   long distances.^[264][65]

   Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent
   outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union
   balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years
   later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25
   million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no
   longer wanted to sell the patent.^[265][66] Bell's investors would
   become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point
   had assets of nearly one million dollars.^[266][67]

   Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures in order to
   introduce the new invention to the [267]scientific community as well as
   the general public. Only one day after, his demonstration of an early
   telephone prototype at the 1876 [268]Centennial Exposition in
   [269]Philadelphia made the telephone the featured headline
   worldwide.^[270][68] Influential visitors to the exhibition included
   [271]Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, and later Bell had the opportunity to
   demonstrate the invention personally to [272]William Thomson, a
   renowned Scottish scientist and even [273]Queen Victoria who had
   requested a private audience at [274]Osborne House, her [275]Isle of
   Wight home; she called the demonstration "most extraordinary". The
   enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for
   universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.^[276][69]

   The [277]Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, over
   150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell company engineers
   made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one
   of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company
   acquired Edison's patents for the [278]carbon microphone from Western
   Union. This made the telephone practical for long distances and it was
   no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

   In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental
   [279]telephone call. Calling from the [280]AT&T head office at 15 Dey
   Street in New York City, Bell was heard by [281]Thomas Watson at 333
   Grant Avenue in [282]San Francisco. The New York Times reported:

   On October 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson talked
   by telephone to each other over a two-mile wire stretched between
   Cambridge and Boston. It was the first wire conversation ever held.
   Yesterday afternoon [on January 25, 1915] the same two men talked by
   telephone to each other over a 3,400-mile (5,500 km) wire between New
   York and San Francisco. Dr. Bell, the veteran inventor of the
   telephone, was in New York, and Mr. Watson, his former associate, was
   on the other side of the continent. They heard each other much more
   distinctly than they did in their first talk thirty-eight years
   ago.^[283][70]

   As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous
   developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were
   at work on the telephone.^[285][3] Over a period of 18 years, the Bell
   Telephone Company faced over 600 lawsuits posing legal challenges
   concerning the rights to the telephone, but none was successful in
   establishing priority over the original Bell patent^[286][71]^[287][72]
   and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to
   a final trial stage.^[288][71] Bell's laboratory notes and family
   letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his
   experiments.^[289][71] The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off
   myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha
   Gray and [290]Amos Dolbear. In personal correspondence to Bell, both
   Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably
   weakened their later claims.^[291][73]

   On 13 January 1887, the United States Government moved to annul the
   patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.
   After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a
   decision in [292]the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original
   claims from the lower court cases were left
   undecided.^[293][74]^[294][75] By the time that the trial wound its way
   through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had
   died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 and dated 7 March 1876 and
   No. 186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although
   the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the
   case's importance as a [295]"precedent." With a change in
   administration and charges of [296]conflict of interest (on both sides)
   arising from the original trial, the [297]U.S. Attorney General dropped
   the law suit on 30 November 1897 leaving several issues undecided
   [298]on the merits.^[299][76]

   During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor
   [300]Antonio Meucci also claimed to have created the first working
   model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three
   cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in
   the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence
   in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his
   inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the
   laboratory of [301]American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York, which
   later, in 1901, was incorporated as a subsidiary of Western
   Union.^[302][77]^[303][78] Meucci's work, like many other inventors of
   the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite
   evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was
   eventually dropped upon Meucci's death.^[304][79] However, due to the
   efforts of Congressman [305]Vito Fossella, the [306]U.S. House of
   Representatives on June 11, 2002 stated that Meucci's "work in the
   invention of the telephone should be acknowledged", even though this
   did not put an end to a still contentious issue.^[307][80]^[308][81]
   ^[309][N 12]^[310][82] Some modern scholars do not agree with the
   claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by Meucci's
   inventions.^[311][83] ^[312][N 13]

   The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and
   patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell
   had delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of
   [313]Siemens & Halske (S&H) managed to set up a rival manufacturer of
   Bell telephones under their own patent. The Siemens company produced
   near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay
   royalties.^[314][84] The establishment of the [315]International Bell
   Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of
   agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global
   telephone operation. The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances
   in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his
   resignation from the company.^[316][85]^[317][N 14]

   members

   On July 11, 1877, a few days after the [320]Bell Telephone Company was
   established, Bell married [321]Mabel Hubbard (1857–1923) at the Hubbard
   estate in [322]Cambridge. His wedding present to his bride was to turn
   over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly created Bell Telephone
   Company.^[323][86] Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a
   year-long honeymoon in Europe. During that excursion, Alec took a
   handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working
   holiday". The courtship had begun years earlier, however Alexander
   waited until he was more financially secure before marrying. Although
   the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially
   a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from
   lectures until after 1897.^[324][87] One unusual request exacted by his
   fiancée was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier
   familiar name of "Aleck." From 1876, he would sign his name "Alec
   Bell."^[325][88]^[326][N 15] They had four children: Elsie May Bell
   (1878–1964) who married [327]Gilbert Grosvenor of [328]National
   Geographic fame,^[329][N 16]^[330][N 17]^[331][N 18] ^[332][N 19]
   Marian Hubbard Bell (1880–1962) who was referred to as "Daisy",^[333][N
   20] and two sons who died in infancy. The Bell family home was located
   in Cambridge, Massachusetts until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought
   a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 the in the same city for
   Bell's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the
   numerous court cases involving patent disputes.^[334][89]

   Bell was a [335]British subject throughout his early life in Scotland
   and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a [336]naturalized
   citizen of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as:
   "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two
   countries."^[337][90] Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly
   claimed as a "native son" by all four countries he resided in: the
   United States, Canada, Scotland and the United Kingdom.^[338][91]

   entrance

   D.C., from 1882–1889.^[340][92]

   By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells
   had a vacation on [341]Cape Breton Island in [342]Nova Scotia, spending
   time at the small village of [343]Baddeck.^[344][93] Returning in 1886,
   Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck,
   overlooking [345]Bras d'Or Lake.^[346][94] By 1889, a large house,
   christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger
   complex of buildings, including a new laboratory,^[347][93] were begun
   that the Bells would name [348]Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: beautiful
   mountain) after Alec's ancestral [349]Scottish highlands.^[350][95]
   ^[351][N 21]Bell would spend his final, and some of his most
   productive, years in residence in both Washington, D.C., where he and
   his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn
   Bhreagh.^[352][96]

   Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between
   the two homes, but Beinn Bhreagh would, over the next 30 years, become
   more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments
   that his annual stays lengthened. Both Mabel and Alec became immersed
   in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their
   own".^[353][93] The Bells were still in residence at Beinn Bhreagh when
   the [354]Halifax Explosion occurred on 6 December 1917. Mabel and Alec
   mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.^[355][97]

Later inventions

   Wikimedia Commons has media related to: [357]Bell's many inventions

   Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the
   invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied.
   According to one of his biographers, [358]Charlotte Gray, Bell's work
   ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went
   to bed voraciously reading the Encyclopædia Britannica, scouring it for
   new areas of interest.^[359][98] The range of Bell's inventive genius
   is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone
   and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the
   telephone and telegraph, four for the [360]Photophone, one for the
   [361]phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes"
   and two for [362]selenium cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range
   of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the
   [363]audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate
   icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and
   work on finding [364]alternative fuels.

   Bell worked extensively in [365]medical research and invented
   techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his [366]Volta
   Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a
   [367]magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound.
   Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they were
   unable to develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never
   realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find
   its application in the [368]tape recorder, the [369]hard disc and
   [370]floppy disc drive and other [371]magnetic media.

   Bell's own home used a primitive form of [372]air conditioning, in
   which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also
   anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial
   pollution. [373]Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the
   waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he
   experimented with [374]composting toilets and devices to capture water
   from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before
   his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [375]solar panels
   to heat houses.

Metal detector

   Bell is also credited with the invention of the [376]metal detector in
   1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the
   bullet in the body of [377]U.S. President [378]James Garfield. The
   metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the
   assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the
   President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in
   static.^[379][99] The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the
   device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not
   fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a
   slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too
   deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.^[380][99] Bell gave a
   full account of his experiments in a paper read before the
   [381]American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in
   August 1882.

Hydrofoils

   Main article: [382]Hydrofoil
   Bell HD-4 on a test run c. 1919

   The March 1906 [383]Scientific American article by American
   [384]hydrofoil pioneer [385]William E. Meacham explained the basic
   principle of [386]hydrofoils and [387]hydroplanes. Bell considered the
   invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on
   information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of
   what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [388]Frederick
   W. "Casey" Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of
   1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied
   the work of the Italian inventor [389]Enrico Forlanini and began
   testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical
   hydrofoil watercraft.

   During his world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini
   in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over
   [390]Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.
   On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as
   experimental models, including the Dhonnas Beag, the first
   self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.^[391][100] The experimental
   boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in
   the more substantial HD-4, powered by [392]Renault engines. A top speed
   of 54 miles per hour (87 km/h) was achieved, with the hydrofoil
   exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with
   the ability to take waves without difficulty.^[393][101] In 1913, Dr.
   Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well
   as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [394]Westmount, Nova Scotia
   to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard
   at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [395]Baddeck,
   Nova Scotia. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make
   useful design changes to the HD-4. After the [396]First World War, work
   began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [397]U.S. Navy permitted
   him to obtain two 350 [398]horsepower (260 [399]kW) engines in July
   1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of
   70.86 miles per hour (114.04 km/h),^[400][102] a record which stood for
   ten years.

Aeronautics

   Main articles: [401]Aerial Experiment Association and [402]AEA Silver
   Dart
   AEA Silver Dart c. 1909

   In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered
   [403]heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared
   the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help
   as Alexander was at the graceful age of 60.

   In 1898, Bell experimented with [404]tetrahedral [405]box kites and
   wings constructed of multiple compound [406]tetrahedral kites covered
   in silk. The tetrahedral wings were named Cygnet I, II and III, and
   were flown both unmanned and manned (Cygnet I crashed during a flight
   carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites
   are on display at the [407]Alexander Graham Bell National Historic
   Site.^[408][103]

   Bell was a supporter of [409]aerospace engineering research through the
   [410]Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck,
   Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife [411]Mabel
   and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real
   estate.^[412][104] The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members
   were four young men: American [413]Glenn H. Curtiss, a motorcycle
   manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man",
   having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest
   time, and who was later awarded the [414]Scientific American Trophy for
   the first official one-kilometre flight in the [415]Western hemisphere,
   and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant
   [416]Thomas Selfridge, an official observer from the [417]U.S.
   government and the only person in the army who believed aviation was
   the future, [418]Frederick W. Baldwin, the first Canadian and first
   British subject to pilot a public flight in [419]Hammondsport, New
   York; and [420]J.A.D. McCurdy; both engineering students at University
   of Toronto.

   The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their
   knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then
   designed and built the [421]Red Wing, framed in bamboo and covered in
   red silk and powered by a small [422]air-cooled engine.^[423][105] On
   March 12, 1908, over [424]Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the
   first public flight in North America.^[425][N 22] ^[426][N 23] The
   innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit
   enclosure and [427]tail rudder (later variations on the original design
   would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA project's
   inventions, the [428]aileron, is a standard component of aircraft
   today. (The aileron was also invented independently by [429]Robert
   Esnault-Pelterie.) The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by
   the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished.
   However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $10,000
   grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with
   experiments.^[430][106]

   Their final aircraft design, the [431]Silver Dart embodied all of the
   advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell
   was present as the Silver Dart flown by J.A.D. McCurdy from the frozen
   ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada. Bell had
   worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor
   to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the
   Silver Dart would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian
   Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the
   Canadian Army.^[432][107]

Eugenics

   Bell was connected with the [433]eugenics movement in the United
   States. In his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of
   the human race presented to the [434]National Academy of Sciences on 13
   November 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely
   to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where
   both parties were deaf should not marry.^[435][108] However, it was his
   hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist
   [436]David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of
   the [437]American Breeders Association. The committee unequivocally
   extended the principle to man.^[438][109] From 1912 until 1918 he was
   the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the [439]Eugenics
   Record Office associated with [440]Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New
   York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary
   president of the [441]Second International Congress of Eugenics held
   under the auspices of the [442]American Museum of Natural History in
   New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with
   success in some states) that established the [443]compulsory
   sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a "defective
   variety of the human race". By the late 1930s, about half the states in
   the U.S. had eugenics laws, and the [444]California laws were used as a
   model for eugenics laws in [445]Nazi Germany.

   Brantford Heritage Inventory, City of Brantford, Ontario, Canada)

   Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most
   famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell
   received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities, to
   the point that the requests almost became burdensome.^[451][110] During
   his life he also received dozens of major awards, medals and other
   tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new
   form of communication his telephone created, notably the [452]Bell
   Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in [453]Brantford, Ontario's
   Alexander Graham Bell Gardens in 1917.^[454][111]

   A large number of Bell's [455]writings, personal correspondence,
   notebooks, papers and other documents reside at both the United States
   [456]Library of Congress Manuscript Division (as the Alexander Graham
   Bell Family Papers), and at the [457]Alexander Graham Bell Institute,
   [458]Cape Breton University, [459]Nova Scotia; major portions of which
   are available for online viewing.

   A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North
   America and Europe, including the first [460]telephone companies of the
   United States and Canada. Among the major sites are:
     * [461]Park's Canada's [462]Alexander Graham Bell National Historic
       Site, which incorporates the Alexander Graham Bell Museum, in
       [463]Baddeck, Nova Scotia, close to the Bell estate Beinn Bhreagh;
     * [464]The Bell Homestead, also known as Melville House, overlooking
       [465]Brantford, Ontario and the [466]Grand River, which was the
       Bell family's first home in North America;
     * Canada's first telephone company building, [467]the Henderson Home,
       of the nascent 1877 [468]Bell Telephone Company of Canada, which
       was carefully relocated in 1969 to the historic Bell Homestead. The
       Bell Homestead and the Bell Telephone Company Building are both
       maintained by the [469]Bell Homestead Society in [470]Brantford,
       Ontario;
     * The [471]Alexander Graham Bell Memorial Park, which features a
       broad neoclassical monument built in 1917 by public subscription.
       The monument graphically depicts mankind's ability to span the
       globe through [472]telecommunications;
     * The [473]Alexander Graham Bell Museum (opened in 1956), part of the
       Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site which was completed in
       1978 in [474]Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Many of the museum's artifacts
       were donated by Bell's daughters;

   Bell Museum, [475]Cape Breton

   In 1880, Bell received the [476]Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000
   francs (approximately US$230,000 in today's dollars^[477][112]) for the
   invention of the telephone from the [478]Académie française,
   representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged
   were [479]Victor Hugo and [480]Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was
   conceived by [481]Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of
   [482]Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its
   history.^[483][113]^[484][114]^[485][115]^[486][116]^[487][117]^[488][1
   18]^[489][119]^[490][120] Since Bell was becoming increasingly
   affluent, he used his [491]prize money to create endowment funds (the
   'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital
   of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory
   Association' (1880), also known as the [492]Volta Laboratory and as the
   'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the
   [493]Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is
   still in operation in [494]Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta
   Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific
   discovery, and the very next year invented a wax [495]phonograph
   cylinder that was later used by Thomas Edison;^[496][121] The
   laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his
   'proudest achievement', the [497]Photophone, the optical telephone
   which presaged [498]fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta
   Bureau would later evolve into the [499]Alexander Graham Bell
   Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading
   center for the research and [500]pedagogy of deafness.

   In partnership with [501]Gardiner Hubbard, Bell helped established the
   publication [502]Science during the early 1880s. In 1888, Bell was one
   of the founding members of the [503]National Geographic Society and
   became its second president (1897–1904), and also became a Regent of
   the [504]Smithsonian Institution (1898–1922). The French government
   conferred on him the decoration of the [505]Légion d'honneur (Legion of
   Honor); the [506]Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the
   [507]Albert Medal in 1902; and the [508]University of Würzburg,
   [509]Bavaria, granted him a Ph.D. He was awarded the [510]Franklin
   Institute's [511]Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912. He was awarded the
   [512]AIEE's [513]Edison Medal in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in
   the invention of the telephone."

   The bel (B) and the smaller [514]decibel (dB) are [515]units of
   measurement of [516]sound intensity invented by [517]Bell Labs and
   named after him.^[518][122] ^[519][N 24]^[520][123] Since 1976 the
   [521]IEEE's [522]Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor
   outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.

                             [523]Issue of 1940

   In 1940 the [524]US Post Office issued a [525]commemorative stamp
   honoring Bell in its [526]'Famous Americans Series'. The First Day of
   Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the
   city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with
   the deaf. The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little
   time. The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one
   of the series.^[527][124]

   The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special
   issue of commemorative £1 [528]banknotes from the [529]Royal Bank of
   Scotland. The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's
   face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and
   career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio [530]wave
   signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from
   engineering structures; representations of [531]sign language and the
   [532]phonetic alphabet; the [533]geese which helped him to understand
   [534]flight; and the [535]sheep which he studied to understand
   [536]genetics.^[537][125] Additionally, the Government of Canada
   honored Bell in 1997 with a $100[538]CAD [539]gold coin, in tribute
   also to the 150th anniversary of his birth,^[540][126] and with a
   [541]silver dollar coin in 2009 to honor of the 100^th anniversary of
   flight in Canada. That first flight was made by an airplane designed
   under Dr. Bell's tutelage, named the Silver Dart^[542][127] Bell's
   image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money,
   coinage and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many
   dozens of years.

   Bell's name is widely known and still used as part of the names of
   dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place
   names around the world. Alexander Graham Bell was also ranked 57th
   among [543]the 100 Greatest Britons (2002) in an official [544]BBC
   nationwide poll, and among the [545]Top Ten Greatest Canadians (2004),
   and [546]the 100 Greatest Americans (2005).^[547][128]^[548][129] In
   2006, Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists
   in history after having been listed in the [549]National Library of
   Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'.^[550][130]
   Bell, an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, receiving an
   honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) at the university in 1906.

Honorary degrees

   Alexander Graham Bell, who was unable to complete the university
   program of his youth, received numerous [552]Honorary Degrees from
   academic institutions, including:
     * [553]Gallaudet College in [554]Washington, D.C. ([555]Ph.D) in 1880
       ^[556][131]
     * [557]Harvard University in [558]Cambridge, Massachusetts
       ([559]LL.D) in 1896
     * [560]University of Würzburg in [561]Würzburg, [562]Bavaria (Ph.D)
       in 1902
     * [563]University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, Scotland (LL.D) in April
       1906 ^[564][132]
     * [565]Queen's University in [566]Kingston, Ontario in 1909
     * [567]Dartmouth College in [568]Hanover, New Hampshire (LL.D) on
       June 25, 1913 ^[569][133]

Death

   Bell died of complications arising from [572]diabetes on August 2,
   1922, at his private estate, Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia, at age
   75.^[573][134] Bell had also been afflicted with [574]pernicious
   anemia.^[575][135] His last view of the earth he had inhabited was of
   the moon ascending over the beloved mountain on his estate at 2:00
   A.M.^[576][93] While tending to her husband after a long illness, Mabel
   whispered, "Don't leave me." By way of reply, Bell traced the sign for
   no—and then he expired.^[577][115]^[578][136]

   On learning of Bell's death, [579]Canadian Prime Minister
   [580]Mackenzie King cabled Mrs. Bell, saying:

     [The Government expresses] to you our sense of the world's loss in
     the death of your distinguished husband. It will ever be a source of
     pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name
     is immortally associated, is a part of its history. On the behalf of
     the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our
     combined gratitude and sympathy.^[581][115]

   Bell's coffin was constructed of Beinn Bhreagh pine by his laboratory
   staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite
   experiments. In order to help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests
   not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his
   service, during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of
   [582]Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Requiem':^[583][137]

     Under a wide and starry sky,
     Dig the grave and let me lie.
     Glad did I live and gladly die
     And I lay me down with a will.

   Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, "every phone on the continent of
   North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind
   the means for direct communication at a distance".^[584][93]^[585][138]

   Dr. Alexander Graham Bell was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on
   his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of
   his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake.^[586][115] He was survived by his
   wife [587]Mabel and his two daughters, Elsie May and
   Marion.^[588][115]^[589][139]

       "...shortly before her fifth birthday...", however Toward provided
       a detailed chronology of the event claiming "...shortly after their
       arrival in New York [in January 1863]....", when Mabel would have
       been at least five years and five weeks of age. Mabel's exact age
       when she became deaf would later play a part in the debate on the
       effectiveness of [614]manual versus oral education for deaf
       children, as children who are older at the onset of deafness retain
       greater vocalization skills and are thus more successful in oral
       education programs. Some of the debate centred on whether Mabel had
       to relearn oral speech from scratch, or whether she never lost it.
