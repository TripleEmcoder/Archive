   Known for [8]Inventor of [9]Styrofoam

   Otis Ray McIntire was born in Gardner, Kansas on August 24, 1918. After
   graduating from the University of Kansas with a B.S. degree in
   engineering in 1940, he went to work as a research engineer for The Dow
   Chemical Company. During World War II, when rubber was in short supply,
   McIntire’s work focused on developing a rubber-like substance that
   could be used as a flexible insulator. In an experiment in which he
   combined styrene with isobutylene, he created a unique material that
   was solid yet flexible due to the tiny bubbles formed by isobutylene
   within the styrene.^[10][1]

   McIntire had invented foam polystyrene, more commonly known by its
   brand name, [11]Styrofoam, that was 30 times lighter and more flexible
   than solid polystyrene. It was also inexpensive and moisture resistant.

   McIntire remained at The Dow Chemical Company for his entire career. He
   was promoted to research director, and later worked in the company’s
   consumer and venture capital divisions. He retired in 1981 as Dow’s
   director of technology and acquisition. In March 2008, McIntire was
   inducted to the [12]National Inventors Hall of Fame.^[13][2]
