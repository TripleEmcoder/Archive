       Died      October 15, 1930(1930-10-15) (aged 64)
   [8]Alma mater [9]Case Western Reserve University

   Herbert Henry Dow (February 26, 1866 – October 15, 1930) was a
   [10]Canadian born, [11]American chemical industrialist. He attended the
   [12]Case Western Reserve University in [13]Cleveland, Ohio, where he
   became a member of the [14]Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. His most
   significant achievement was as founder and [15]eponym of [16]Dow
   Chemical Company, which was incorporated with 57 original
   stockholders^[17][1] in 1897. Two years later, he also started the
   [18]Dow Gardens in [19]Midland, Michigan as a personal hobby. H.H. Dow
   High School in Midland, Michigan, is named after Dow. Among his awards
   is the [20]Perkin Medal, received in 1930.

[[29]edit] Biography

[[30]edit] Early years

   Herbert Henry Dow was born in 1866 in [31]Belleville, Ontario
   ([32]Canada), the eldest child of Joseph Henry Dow, an inventor and
   mechanical engineer. Six weeks after his birth, the family returned to
   their hometown of [33]Derby, Connecticut.^[34][2] They moved again in
   1878, this time to [35]Cleveland, Ohio ([36]USA) to follow his father's
   job with the Derby Shovel Manufacturing Company.

   Dow was a precocious child, often helping his father with mechanical
   problems, and inventing an incubator for chicken eggs before he was 12.
   Several years later he and his father coinvented a small steam turbine
   which the [37]United States Navy used for many years in torpedo
   propulsion.^[38][3]

   After graduating from high school in 1884, Dow enrolled in what is now
   [39]Case Western Reserve University, then known as the Case School of
   Applied Science. While at Case, he began researching which chemicals
   could be found in [40]brines in [41]Ohio and other areas of the United
   States. He discovered that brine samples from [42]Canton, Ohio and
   [43]Midland, Michigan were very rich in [44]bromine, which at the time
   was a primary ingredient in medicines and was used heavily in the
   fledgeling photographic industry.^[45][3] Following his graduation from
   Case in 1888, Dow worked for a year as a chemistry professor at Huron
   Street Hospital College in Cleveland, still continuing his research
   into the extraction of chemicals from brine. In 1889 Dow received his
   first patent after inventing a more cost-effective and streamlined
   process for extracting bromine from brine. He quickly formed his own
   company, but was bankrupt within the year. His associates were
   impressed with his work and in 1890 helped him to found the Midland
   Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan.^[46][2] Dow continued his work
   for extracting bromine and by early 1891 he had invented a method of
   bromine extraction that became known as the [47]Dow process, using
   electrolysis to successfully oxidize bromide to bromine.^[48][3]

[[49]edit] Foundation of Dow Chemical

   Dow was not content with simply improving the bromine extraction
   process, but wanted to expand his research of electrolysis to yield
   other chemicals. His financial backers did not approve of his continued
   research and fired him from the Midland Chemical Company.^[50][4] He
   continued his research, developing a process to extract chloride and
   caustic soda from sodium chloride. After seeking funding from potential
   backers in Cleveland including family friends and former Case School of
   Applied Science classmates, Dow secured funds from James T. Pardee,
   Albert W. Smith, J.H. Osborn, and Cady Staley. In 1895, Dow moved his
   family to Ohio and founded the Dow Process Company to develop the
   production mechanism for his process.^[51][5] The following year he
   returned to Midland, where he formed the [52]Dow Chemical Company as
   successor to the Dow Process Company. Within three years, his new
   company had purchased the Midland Chemical Company.^[53][3]

[[54]edit] Breaking a Monopoly

   With his new company and new technology, Dow was able to produce
   bromine very cheaply, and began selling it in the United States for 36
   cents per pound. At the time, the government-supported German bromine
   [55]cartel, [56]Bromkonvention, had a near-[57]monopoly on the supply
   of bromine, which they sold for 49 cents per pound. The Germans had
   made it clear that they would flood the American market with cheap
   bromine if Dow attempted to sell the element abroad. In 1904 Dow defied
   the cartel by beginning to export his bromine at its cheaper price to
   England. A few months later, an angry Bromkonvention representative
   visited Dow in his office and reminded him to cease exporting his
   bromine.^[58][6]

   Unafraid, Dow continued exporting to England and Japan. The German
   cartel retaliated by flooding the US market with bromine at a mere 15
   cents a pound in an attempt to put him out of business. Dow, unable to
   compete with the attempt at [59]predatory pricing in the U.S.,
   instructed his agents to quietly buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds
   of the German bromine locally at the low price. The Dow company then
   turned the tables on the cartel by repackaging the bromine and
   exporting it to Europe, including Germany, at 27 cents a pound. The
   cartel, expecting Dow to go out of business, was unable to comprehend
   what was driving the enormous demand for bromine in the U.S., and where
   all the cheap imported bromine flooding their market was coming from.
   They even suspected their own members of violating their price-fixing
   agreement and selling in Germany below the cartel's fixed cost. The
   befuddled cartel continued to slash prices on their bromine in the
   U.S., first to 12 cents a pound, and then to 10.5 cents per pound. Dow
   continued selling the dumped bromine in Germany at 27 cents per pound.
   When the cartel finally caught on to Dow's tactic, they realized they
   could not keep selling below cost, and were forced to increase their
   prices worldwide. Dow's triumph has been used as an argument that
   [60]predatory pricing is an irrational practice that would never work
   in the real world.^[61][6]

[[62]edit] World War I

   The new company focused on research, and soon was able to extract many
   more chemicals from brine. The company was given a large opportunity to
   grow during [63]World War I, when Britain blockaded the ports of
   Germany, which at the time included most of the world's largest
   chemical suppliers. Dow Chemical quickly moved to fill the gap,
   producing [64]magnesium for incendiary flares, [65]monochlorobenzene
   and [66]phenol for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas.
   By 1918, 90% of the Dow Chemical Company production was in support of
   the war effort.^[67][3] During this time period, Dow also created the
   diamond logo that is still used by the Dow Chemical Company.^[68][7]

   Following the conclusion of the War, Dow began to research the benefits
   of magnesium, which the company had in large supply. He discovered that
   it could be used to make automobile pistons. The new pistons proved to
   give more speed and better fuel efficiency. The Dowmetal pistons were
   used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the
   [69]Indianapolis 500 used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.^[70][3]

   By the time of his death on October 15, 1930 from [71]cirrhosis of the
   liver,^[72][3] Dow had personally received over 90 patents.^[73][8] Dow
   was survived by his wife, Grace, and five of their seven
   children.^[74][9]

[[75]edit] Commemoration

   His home in Midland, known as [76]Herbert H. Dow House, was declared a
   U.S. [77]National Historic Landmark in 1976.
