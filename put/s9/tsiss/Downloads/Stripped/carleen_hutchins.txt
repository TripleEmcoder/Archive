                       Carleen Hutchins
      Born    May 5, 1911
              [7]Springfield, Massachusetts, [8]United States
      Died    August 7, 2009(2009-08-07) (aged 98)
              [9]Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, United States
   Occupation acoustician, violinmaker and researcher

   Carleen Maley Hutchins (May 24, 1911 – August 7, 2009) was an
   [10]American former high school science teacher, violinmaker and
   researcher, best-known for her creation, in the 1950s/60s, of a family
   of eight proportionally-sized violins now known as the [11]violin octet
   (e.g., the [12]vertical viola) and for a considerable body of research
   into the acoustics of violins. She was born in [13]Springfield,
   Massachusetts.

   Hutchins’s greatest innovation, still used by many violinmakers, was a
   technique known as free-plate tuning. When not attached to a violin,
   the top and back are called free plates. Her technique gives makers a
   precise way to refine these plates before a violin is assembled.

   From 2002 to 2003, Hutchins’s octet was the subject of an exhibition at
   the [14]Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Titled “The New Violin
   Family: Augmenting the String Section.” Hutchins was the founder of the
   [15]New Violin Family Association^[16][1], creator-in-chief of the
   Violin Octet, author of more than 100 technical publications, editor of
   two volumes of collected papers in violin acoustics, four grants from
   the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music, recipient of two
   [17]Guggenheim Fellowships, an Honorary Fellowship from the Acoustical
   Society of America, and four honorary doctorates. In 1963, Hutchins
   co-founded the Catgut Acoustical Society, which develops scientific
   insights into the construction of new and conventional instruments of
   the violin family.

   The Hutchins Consort, named after Hutchins, is a California ensemble
   featuring all eight instruments.^[18][2]

   In 1974, Hutchins and Daniel W. Haines, using materials supplied by the
   Hercules Materials Company, Inc. (Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory) of
   Cumberland, Maryland, developed a graphite-epoxy composite top that was
   determined to be a successful alternative to the traditional use of
   spruce for the violin belly.^[19][3]
