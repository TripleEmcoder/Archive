              Frank Edward McGurrin
    Born   April 2, 1861(1861-04-02) ^[7][1]
           [8]Grand Rapids
    Died   August 17, 1933(1933-08-17) (aged 72)

   Partner Jane Darling McGurrin

   Frank Edward McGurrin (April 2, 1861 – August 17, 1933) invented
   [11]Touch Typing in 1878.^[12][2] He was a court [13]stenographer at
   [14]Salt Lake City who taught typing classes. He taught himself to
   touch type without looking at the keys, before challenging and won a
   competition.

[[15]edit] History

   On July 25, 1888, McGurrin, who was purportedly the only person using
   touch typing at the time, won a decisive victory over [16]Louis Traub
   (operating [17]Caligraph with [18]eight-finger method) in a typing
   contest held in [19]Cincinnati. The results were displayed on the front
   pages of many newspapers.^[20][3] McGurrin won $500 ($10,820 in 2006)
   and popularized the new typing method.

   Whether McGurrin was actually the first person to touch type, or simply
   the first to be popularly noticed, is disputed. Speeds attained by
   other typists in other typing competitions at the time suggest that
   they must have been using similar systems.^[21][4]

[[22]edit] The First Touch Operator

   The following interesting story of how Mr. McGurrin came to operate the
   typewriter by «touch» is thus told in his own word:
   “ I first began using the method in 1878 under the following
     circumstances. I was a clerk in the law office of D. E. Corbitt, in
     [23]Grand Rapids, [24]Michigan. He bought a second-hand No. 1
     (Remington) Typewriter, with the tin front and back, on which the
     carriage was pulled back by a string and a sledgehammer blow was
     required to depress the keys. My employer and I began practicing on it
     at the same time and there was quite a rivalry between us for some
     months as to who could write the faster. Those were my first
     typewriting contests. Before long I could beat him so easily that he
     give up the struggle. One day he came into the office and told some on
     else who was there that he had just been over to the office of Henry F.
     Welch, was dictating from his notes to a girl who was running the
     typewriter while looking out of the window. All this while she was
     writing from dictation at a very rapid rate. I afterwards learned that
     this was a fairy tale and only told in my presence to take the conceit
     out of me. However, boy like, I made up my mind that whatever a girl
     could do I could do, so I set to work to learn to operate without
     looking at the keyboard. I discarded my former method of two or three
     fingers and determined to use all of my fingers. Before the end of the
     year 1878 I could write upwards of 90 words a minute in new matter
     without looking at the keyboard. I did not meet the girl in Mr. Welch’s
     office for two years after and then learned to my surprise that she did
     not operate the machine without looking at the keyboard and had never
     attempted to do so. I do not take any great credit for having thought
     of operating without looking at the keyboard for it is simply a matter
     of common sense, and the system of fingering is so simple that anybody
     could formulate it.»

     «Mr. Welch is still the court reporter at Grand Rapids and can vouch
     for the fact that as early as 1878, I was operating the machine by
     touch.
                                                                              ”

   —Frank Edward McGurrin^[25][2]

   Everyone should be glad that Mr. Corbitt made this effort «to take the
   conceit out of» Mr. McGurrin, not because Mr. McGurrin needed any such
   medicine, but because the result was the development of an operator who
   was the first to demonstrate that «touch» writing was not an
   unattainable ideal, but could actually be accomplished with a saving of
   time and labor. This new achievement in typewriter operating
   immediately attracted wide attention. Mr. Theodore C. Rose,
   Vice-President of the International Convention of Shorthand Writers, at
   the meeting at [26]Chicago on September 1, 1881, made the following
   reference to Mr. McGurrin’s work: «I would say that in the past week I
   was in the office of Walsh & Ford, in Grand Rapids, and that a young
   man in their office, on a test, wrote ninety-seven words on the
   type-writer, and read the copy. He did n't look at the machine, at all,
   but kept his eye on the copy. I know he wrote ninety-seven words in a
   minute, because I held the watch.» This utterance is also notable
   because it is probably the first reference to what we now know ad the
   «touch system» contained in the reports of any of the
   conventions.^[27][5]
