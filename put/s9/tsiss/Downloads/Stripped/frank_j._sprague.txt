   Frank Julian Sprague (July 25, 1857 in [16]Milford, Connecticut -
   October 25, 1934) was an [17]American [18]naval officer and
   [19]inventor who contributed to the development of the [20]electric
   motor, [21]electric railways, and [22]electric elevators. His
   contributions were especially important in promoting [23]urban
   development by increasing the size cities could reasonably attain
   (through better transportation) and by allowing greater concentration
   of business in commercial sections (through use of electric elevators
   in [24]skyscrapers). He became known as the "Father of Electric
   Traction".

[[36]edit] Childhood, education

   Sprague was born in [37]Milford, Connecticut in 1857. He attended
   [38]Drury High School in [39]North Adams, Massachusetts and excelled in
   mathematics. In 1874, he won an appointment to the [40]United States
   Naval Academy in [41]Annapolis, Maryland. There, he graduated seventh
   (out of thirty-six) in the Class of 1878.

[[42]edit] U.S. Navy, inventor

   He was commissioned as an [43]ensign in the [44]U.S. Navy. During his
   ensuing naval service, he first served on the [45]USS Richmond, then
   the [46]USS Minnesota. While his ship was in [47]Newport, Rhode Island,
   in 1881, Sprague invented the inverted type of [48]dynamo. After he was
   transferred to the [49]USS Lancaster, flagship of the European
   Squadron, he installed the first electric call-bell system on a U.S.
   Navy ship. Sprague took leave to attend the [50]Paris Electrical
   Exhibition in 1881 and the [51]Crystal Palace Exhibition in
   [52]Sydenham, England in 1882, where he was on the jury of awards for
   gas engines, [53]dynamos and lamps.

[[54]edit] Joining the emerging electrical industry

   In 1883, [55]Edward H. Johnson, a business associate of [56]Thomas
   Edison, persuaded Sprague to resign his naval commission to work for
   Edison. One of Sprague's significant contributions to the Edison
   Laboratory at [57]Menlo Park, New Jersey was the introduction of
   mathematical methods. Prior to his arrival, Edison conducted many
   costly trial-and-error experiments. Sprague's approach was to calculate
   using mathematics the optimum parameters and thus save much needless
   tinkering. He did important work for Edison, including correcting
   Edison's system of mains and feeders for central station distribution.
   In 1884, he decided his interests in the exploitation of electricity
   lay elsewhere, and he left Edison to found the Sprague Electric Railway
   & Motor Company.

   By 1886, Sprague's company had introduced two important inventions: a
   constant-speed, non-sparking motor with fixed brushes, and a method to
   return power to the main supply systems of equipment driven by electric
   motors. His motor was the first to maintain constant speed under
   varying load. It was immediately popular, and was endorsed by Edison as
   the only practical electric motor available. His method of returning
   power to main supply systems was important in the development of the
   electric train and the electric elevator.

[[58]edit] Richmond: inventing the trolley-pole

   Postcard of electric trolley-powered streetcars in [59]Richmond,
   Virginia in 1923, two generations after Frank J. Sprague successfully
   demonstrated his new system on the hills in 1888. The intersection
   shown is at 8th & Broad Streets.

   Sprague's inventions included a system on [60]streetcars for collecting
   electricity from [61]overhead wires. His spring-loaded [62]trolley
   pole, invented in 1880,^[63][1] used a wheel to travel along the wire.
   In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague
   installed the first successful large electric street railway system,
   the [64]Richmond Union Passenger Railway in [65]Richmond, Virginia.
   Long a transportation obstacle, the hills of Richmond included grades
   of over 10%, and were an excellent proving ground for acceptance of his
   new technology in other cities, in contrast to the [66]cable cars which
   climbed the steepest grades of [67]Nob Hill in [68]San Francisco at the
   time.

   Within a year, electric power had replaced more costly [69]horsecars in
   many cities. By 1889 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's
   equipment had been begun or planned on several continents. In 1890,
   Edison, who manufactured most of Sprague's equipment, [70]bought him
   out, and Sprague turned his attention to electric elevators.

   Sprague's system of electric supply was a great advantage in relation
   to the first bipolar U-tube overhead lines, in everyday use since 1883
   on [71]Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram.

[[72]edit] Electric elevators

   While electrifying the streetcars of Richmond, the increased passenger
   capacity and speed gave Sprague the notion that similar results could
   be achieved in vertical transportation: electric elevators. He saw that
   increasing the capacity of [73]elevator shaft ways would not only save
   passengers' time, but would also increase the earnings of tall
   buildings, with height limited by the total floor space taken up in the
   shaft ways by slow hydraulic-powered elevators.

   In 1892, Sprague founded the Sprague Electric Elevator Company, and
   with [74]Charles R. Pratt developed the Sprague-Pratt Electric
   Elevator. The company developed floor control, automatic elevators,
   acceleration control of car safeties and a number of freight elevators.
   The Spague-Pratt [75]elevator ran faster and with larger loads than
   hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 elevators had been installed
   worldwide. Sprague then sold his company to the [76]Otis Elevator
   Company in 1895.

[[77]edit] Multiple unit train controls

   Sprague's experience with elevator control led him to devise a
   [78]multiple unit system of electric railway operation, which
   accelerated the development of [79]electric traction. In the multiple
   unit system, each car of the train carries electric traction motors. By
   means of relays energized by train-line wires, the [80]engineer (or
   [81]motorman) commands all of the traction motors in the train to act
   together. For lighter trains there is no need for [82]locomotives, so
   every car in the train can generate revenue. Where locomotives are
   used, one person can control all of them.

   Sprague's first multiple unit order was from the [83]South Side
   Elevated Railroad (the first of several elevated railways in locally
   known as the [84]"L") in [85]Chicago, Illinois. This success was
   quickly followed by substantial multiple-unit contracts in
   [86]Brooklyn, New York and [87]Boston, Massachusetts.

[[88]edit] New York: Grand Central, elevators in skyscrapers

   From 1896 to 1900 Sprague served on the Commission for Terminal
   Electrification of the [89]New York Central Railroad, including the
   [90]Grand Central Terminal in [91]New York City, where he designed a
   system of automatic train control to ensure compliance with trackside
   signals. He founded the Sprague Safety Control & Signal Corporation to
   develop and build this system. Along with [92]William J. Wilgus, he
   designed the Wilgus-Sprague bottom contact [93]third rail system used
   by the railroads leading into Grand Central Terminal.^[94][2]

   During [95]World War I, Sprague served on the Naval Consulting Board.
   Then, in the 1920s, he devised a method for safely running two
   independent elevators, local and express, in a single shaft, to
   conserve floor space. He sold this system, along with systems for
   activating elevator car safety systems when acceleration or speed
   became too great, to the [96]Westinghouse Company.

[[97]edit] Heritage, awards

   The effect of Sprague's developments in electric traction was to permit
   an expansion in the size of cities, while his development of the
   elevator permitted greater concentration in cities' commercial sections
   and increased the profitability of commercial buildings. Sprague's
   inventions over 100 years ago made possible modern [98]light rail and
   [99]rapid transit systems which still function on the same principles
   today.

   Sprague was awarded the gold medal at the [100]Paris Electrical
   Exhibition in 1889, the grand prize at the [101]St. Louis Exhibition in
   1904, the [102]Elliott Cresson Medal in 1904, the [103]Edison Medal of
   the [104]American Institute of Electrical Engineers, now [105]IEEE, in
   1910 'For meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering
   and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto', the
   [106]Franklin Medal in 1921 and the [107]John Fritz Gold Medal
   (posthumously) in 1935.

   "All through his life and up to his last day, Frank Sprague had a
   prodigious capacity for work," his son Robert wrote in 1935. "And once
   having made up his mind on a new invention or a new line of work, he
   was tireless and always striving for improvement. He had a brilliantly
   alert mind and was impatient of any half-way compromise. His interest
   in his work never ceased; only a few hours before the end, he asked to
   have a newly designed model of his latest invention brought to his
   bedside."

   Frank and Harriet Sprague had two sons, Robert and Julian. Robert
   founded the [108]Sprague Electric Company which became a leading
   manufacturer of capacitors and other electronic components. The company
   was later bought by Vishay in the 1990s.

   After Sprague died in 1934, his widow Harriet turned over a substantial
   amount of material from his collection to the [109]New York Public
   Library, where it remains today accessible to the public via the rare
   books division. He was buried at [110]Arlington National Cemetery in
   [111]Arlington, Virginia, and she was interred beside him after her
   death in 1969.

   In 1959, Harriet Sprague had donated funds for the Sprague Building at
   the [112]Shore Line Trolley Museum at [113]East Haven, Connecticut, not
   far from Sprague's boyhood home in Milford. The museum is the oldest
   operating trolley museum in the United States, and has one of the
   largest collections of trolley artifacts in the United States.

   In 1999, two of Frank and Harriet's grandsons, John L. Sprague and
   Peter Sprague, cut the ribbon and started an 1884 Sprague motor at a
   new exhibit at the Shore Line Trolley Museum. There, a permanent
   exhibit, "Frank J. Sprague: Inventor, Scientist, Engineer", helps tell
   the story of the part electricity played in the growth of cities as
   well as the role of the Father of Electric Traction. Entrepreneur Peter
   Sprague was Chairman of [114]National Semiconductor from 1965 until
   1995. John Sprague was President and Chief Executive Officer of Sprague
   Electric Company from 1981 to 1987.
