   Thaddeus Sobieski Coulincourt Lowe (August 20, 1832 - January 16,
   1913), also known as Professor T. S. C. Lowe, was an [18]American Civil
   War aeronaut, scientist and inventor, mostly self-educated in the
   fields of [19]chemistry, [20]meteorology, and [21]aeronautics. By the
   late 1850s he was well known for his advanced theories in the
   meteorological sciences as well as his balloon building. Among his
   aspirations were plans for a transatlantic flight.

   Lowe's scientific endeavors were cut short by the onset of the
   [22]American Civil War. He recognized his patriotic duty in offering
   his services as an aeronaut for the purposes of performing aerial
   reconnaissance on the Confederate troops on behalf of the [23]Union
   Army. In July 1861 Lowe was appointed Chief Aeronaut of the [24]Union
   Army Balloon Corps by President [25]Abraham Lincoln. Though his work
   was generally successful, it was not fully appreciated by all members
   of the military, and disputes over his operations and pay scale forced
   him to resign in 1863. Lowe returned to the private sector and
   continued his scientific exploration of hydrogen gas manufacturing. He
   invented the [26]water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen
   gas could be produced from steam and charcoal. His inventions and
   patents on this process and ice making machines made him a millionaire.

   In 1887 he moved to [27]Los Angeles, California, and eventually built a
   24,000 sq. ft. (2,230 m^2) home in [28]Pasadena. He opened several ice
   making plants and founded Citizen's Bank of Los Angeles. Lowe was
   introduced to [29]David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer, who had drawn
   up plans for a scenic mountain railroad. In 1891 they incorporated the
   Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad Co. and began the construction of what
   would become the Mount Lowe Railway into the hills above [30]Altadena.
   The railway opened on July 4, 1893 and was met with quick interest and
   success. Lowe continued construction toward Oak Mountain, renamed
   [31]Mount Lowe, at an exhaustive rate, both physically and financially.
   By 1899 Lowe had gone into receivership and eventually lost the railway
   to Jared S. Torrance. Lowe's fortunes had been all but lost, and he
   lived out his remaining days at his daughter's home in Pasadena where
   he died at age 81.

[[50]edit] Early life

[[51]edit] Heritage

   Thaddeus Lowe was born August 20, 1832 to Clovis and Alpha Green Lowe
   in [52]Jefferson Mills, [53]Coos County, New Hampshire. Lowe’s
   grandfather, Levi Lowe, fought in the [54]Revolutionary War, and his
   father was a drummer boy in the [55]War of 1812. Both Clovis and Alpha
   were native New Hampshirites, of pioneer stock and descendants of 17th
   century [56]Pilgrims. Clovis was a [57]cobbler, but later became a
   merchant in Jefferson. He dabbled in politics and was even elected to
   state legislature at one time. His politics and opinion were well
   respected in the state.^[58][1]

[[59]edit] Youth

   Versions of the life of young Thaddeus vary. He was the second child in
   a family of five and was named Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine, more than
   likely after the character Thaddeus Constantine Sobieski ([60]Tadeusz
   Kosciuszko) in an 1803 novel ‘’Thaddeus of Warsaw’’ by Scottish author
   [61]Jane Porter.^[62][2] It is confused about his life around the age
   of ten whether his mother had died and Clovis married Mary Randall, or
   if Lowe was sent away to another farm during which time his mother died
   and his father remarried. He apparently did work for another farm owned
   by the Plaisted’s, but whether or not he lived there is
   uncertain.^[63][3] Clovis and Mary had seven more children, but there
   is a timeline confusion that may indicate she already had children when
   she married Clovis.^[64][4]

   What is consistent in the stories of Lowe are accounts of his
   insatiable appetite for learning. He could not read enough material,
   and he had questions beyond the answering of his father or teachers.
   Lowe was also limited in the amount of time he had for school. His farm
   chores only allowed him the three winter months to attend Common School
   at Jefferson Hills, two miles away. The school had no books, but like
   Abraham Lincoln Thad would spend his evenings in front of the fireplace
   reading books loaned from his teacher’s personal library.^[65][5]

   By age fourteen Thad had ventured out on his own first to [66]Portland,
   Maine, then back to Boston where he joined his older brother Joseph in
   the shoe [parts] cutting trade. At eighteen Thad became quite ill and
   returned home. While he was still recuperating when his younger brother
   invited him to attend a chemistry lecture by one Professor Reginald
   Dinkelhoff featuring the phenomena of lighter-than-air gases,
   specifically hydrogen.^[67][6] When the Professor requested a volunteer
   from the audience, an eager Thaddeus jumped to the fore. Dinkelhoff
   could see the interest in his eyes and after the show offered to take
   him on the road with him as an assistant. Lowe did so and after two
   years upon the professor’s retirement bought out the show using the
   appellation “Thaddeus Sobieski Counlicourt Lowe, Professor of
   Chemistry.”^[68][7]

[[69]edit] Self-made scientist and aeronaut

   The lecture circuit business proved lucrative enough for Lowe to seek
   out the education he so lacked as a child. He tried studying
   [70]medicine to fulfill his grandmother's wish, but the boredom
   redirected him to his first interest, [71]aviation with the use of
   lighter-than-air gases. American balloonists used [72]coke gas to
   inflate limp silk bags, as opposed to the original French [73]balloons
   which were cotton weave over rigid frameworks that were stood over
   fires to collect hot smoke (hot air). By the late 1850s Lowe had become
   a foremost balloon builder and continued his lucrative business as a
   showman giving balloon rides to passersby and [74]fairground attendees.
   Leontine Augustine Gaschon Lowe

   In 1855, at one of his lectures, he was introduced to a pretty Parisian
   actress, 19-year-old Leontine Augustine Gaschon. (Her father was a
   palace guard of King Louis Phillipe who fled to the U.S. as a political
   refugee.)^[75][8] A week later, on February 14, 1855, Thaddeus and
   Leontine wed. Their union would produce ten children, seven girls and
   three boys. Lowe continued with his scientific endeavors and the dream
   of owning his own balloon with the wild idea of making a
   [76]transatlantic flight via the high winds he observed. He pored over
   the book of [77]John Wise, A System of Aeronautics which had specific
   instructions for the construction of aerostats, the cutting, the
   sewing, the leak proofing.^[78][9]

   In 1857 Lowe built and piloted his first balloon in tethered flight at
   a small farm in [79]Hoboken, New Jersey. Thad’s father joined in the
   balloon making business and had become an accomplished aeronaut
   himself.^[80][10] In 1858 the Lowes built the larger balloon
   [81]Enterprise and several others.

   Lowe continued with his scientific endeavors and avocation to make a
   [82]transatlantic flight via the high winds. In 1859 Lowe began the
   construction of a mammoth balloon to be named the City of New York.
   Meanwhile he espoused the theory of transatlantic flight to many who
   had stock market interests in Europe. The recently laid transatlantic
   cable had failed, and sea travel was undependably slow. He amassed
   supporters from all corners of the business and scientific communities,
   in particular one Prof. [83]Joseph Henry of the [84]Smithsonian
   Institution who wrote:

          The Smithsonian Institution has long been aware of the work and
          theories of Professor Lowe^[85][11] and we have found his
          statements scientifically sound. It is with great pleasure and
          satisfaction that we welcome proof of his genius. We shall
          follow the outcome of his plan with interest.^[86][12]

[[87]edit] Transatlantic attempts

   Lowe's mammoth balloon the City of New York, later named Great Western,
   to be used in a transatlantic flight.

   Lowe's latest mammoth balloon, the City of New York, was a massive
   103-foot (31.394 m.) diameter balloon with an 11-1/2 ton (10,432.6 kg)
   lift capacity (on coke gas, 22-1/2 ton [20,411.6 kg.] on hydrogen),
   which included a 20-foot (6 m.) diameter, 8-man canvas covered gondola
   and a suspended lifeboat named for his wife Leontine. It was prepared
   for a test flight to be launched at Reservoir Square in New York on
   November 1, 1859. Unfortunately the local gas company was not able to
   deliver a sufficient supply of gas. Within a week Lowe was invited to
   Philadelphia by Prof. John C. Cresson of the Benjamin Franklin
   Institute of Sciences, who also happened to be Chairman of the Board of
   the Point Breeze Gas Works. They promised a sufficient supply of gas.
   Lowe stored the balloon in Hoboken and waited for spring to do the test
   flight.^[88][13]

   Before the test flight the balloon was renamed the Great Western, on
   the advice of newspaperman [89]Horace Greeley, to rival the maiden
   voyage of the steamship [90]Great Eastern in the spring of 1860. Lowe
   made the flight successfully on June 28, 1860, from Philadelphia to New
   Jersey, but on his first attempt at a transatlantic launch on September
   7, the Great Western was ripped open by a wind. A second attempt on
   September 29 was halted when the repaired spot on the balloon bulged
   during inflation. Lowe would need to overhaul the GW and wait for the
   next late spring.^[91][14]
   Lowe's intended flight from Cincinnati shown in red. Actual flight in
   blue.^[92][15]

   A second test flight, at the suggestion of Prof. Henry, was made from
   [93]Cincinnati and was to return him to the eastern seaboard. For this
   flight he used the smaller balloon Enterprise.^[94][16] His flight took
   off on the early morning of April 19, 1861, two days after [95]Virginia
   had seceded from [96]the Union. The flight misdirected him to
   Unionville, South Carolina where he was put under house arrest as a
   [97]Yankee spy.^[98][17] Having established his identity as a man of
   science, he was allowed to return home where he had received word from
   Secretary of the Treasury [99]Salmon P. Chase to come to Washington
   with his balloon. The [100]American Civil War permanently ended Lowe's
   attempt at a transatlantic crossing.

[[101]edit] Participation in the Civil War (1861-1863)

   Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, ca. 1865

[[102]edit] Chief Aeronaut

   On the evening of June 11, 1861 Lowe met [103]President Lincoln and
   offered to perform a demonstration with the Enterprise and a
   [104]telegraph set from a height some 500 feet (152.4 m.) above the
   [105]White House. In the telegraph message Lowe asserted:
   “ I have the pleasure of sending you this first dispatch ever
     telegraphed from an aerial station...^[106][18]              ”

   Lowe was competing for the position with three other prominent
   balloonists, [107]John Wise, [108]John LaMountain, and brothers
   [109]Ezra Allen and [110]James Allen. Wise and LaMountain were old
   critics of Lowe, but were not able to obtain the assignment so easily.

   Lowe's first outing was at the [111]First Battle of Bull Run, with
   General [112]Irvin McDowell and the [113]Army of Northeastern Virginia.
   His performance was impressive, though he had the misfortune of having
   to land behind enemy lines. Fortunately he was found by members of the
   31st New York Volunteers before the enemy could discover him, but after
   landing, he had twisted his ankle and was not able to walk out with
   them. They returned to Fort Corcoran to report his position. Eventually
   his wife Leontine, disguised as an old hag, came to his rescue with a
   buckboard and canvas covers and was able to extract him and his
   equipment safely.^[114][19]

   Word of his exploits got back to the President, who ordered General
   [115]Winfield Scott to see to Lowe's formation of a balloon corps, with
   Lowe as Chief Aeronaut. It was almost four months before Lowe received
   orders and provisions to construct four (eventually seven) balloons
   equipped with mobile hydrogen gas generators. At the same time he
   assembled a band of men whom he would instruct in the methodology of
   military ballooning. The newly formed [116]Union Army Balloon Corps
   remained a civilian contract organization, never receiving military
   commissions, a dangerous position lest any one of the men be captured
   as spies and summarily executed.^[117][20]

[[118]edit] Peninsula Campaign

   Lowe returned to the Army of the Potomac now under General [119]George
   McClellan, with his new military balloon the Eagle, though his
   generators were not ready. He performed ascensions over Yorktown, after
   which the Confederates retreated toward Richmond. Lowe was given use of
   a converted coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, onto which
   he loaded two new balloons and two new hydrogen gas generators, with
   which Lowe performed the first observations over water thereby making
   the GWP Custis the first ever aircraft carrier. In Lowe’s Official
   Report to the Secretary Of War, he stated:
   Prof. Lowe ascending in the Intrepid to observe the Battle of Fair Oaks
   “ I have the pleasure of reporting the complete success of the first
     balloon expedition by water ever attempted.                         ”

   Lowe went on to serve in the [120]Peninsula Campaign of 1862, making
   observations over [121]Mechanicsville, Virginia, and the ensuing
   [122]Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks.^[123][21]

   The picture to the right depicts Lowe's ascent in the Intrepid over the
   Battle of Seven Pines, where his observations of the oncoming
   [124]Confederate Army and the timely manner in which he reported troop
   movements saved the isolated army of General [125]Samuel P.
   Heintzelman. Though he had used the hydrogen gas generators (each
   balloon camp was assigned two generator units), the inflation time was
   still another hour off. He quickly transferred the gas from the
   Constitution into the Intrepid by cutting a hole in the bottom of a
   camp kettle and connecting the balloons at the valve ends. The process
   took fifteen minutes, a time savings later valued at "a million dollars
   a minute."^[126][22]

   The muddy bogs around Fair Oaks and the Chickahominy River gave rise to
   many exotic diseases such as typhoid and malaria. Lowe contracted
   malaria and was put out of service for more than a month.^[127][23] The
   unsuccessful Army of the Potomac was ordered to retreat to Washington,
   and Lowe's wagons and mules were commandeered for the withdrawal and
   eventually returned to the Quartermaster. When Lowe returned to
   Washington, he was hard pressed to be put back into service. Eventually
   he was called to Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg, where his services were
   used.^[128][24]

[[129]edit] End of the Balloon Corps

   The Balloon Corps was reassigned to the Engineers Corps. Lowe had been
   paid as a colonel ($10 gold per day), but in March 1863, Captain
   Comstock was put in charge of the newly reassigned air division and cut
   Lowe's pay to $6 cash ($3 gold). At the same time, a Congressional
   assessment was being made of the air division and a disparaging third
   party report, which Lowe refuted in a lengthy response, gave pause to
   the Union commanders for further use of balloons. In addition, Lowe's
   appointments of personnel independent of the engineer officers had
   strained his relations with the military.^[130][25] Lowe tendered his
   resignation in May 1863 and the Allen brothers took charge of the
   Balloon Corps, but by August, the Corps had ceased to exist.^[131][26]

[[132]edit] Return to the private sector

   Lowe sought to recuperate from the effects of malaria and the fatigue
   of war. He and Leontine returned to [133]Jefferson, New Hampshire,
   where he spent time with his family. He had a month’s return to
   Washington in the fall of 1863 to complete his war report to the
   Secretary, then returned home to buy a farm near Valley Forge, where
   the farming life allowed him to recompose himself.^[134][27]

   The advanced techniques of aerial reconnaissance developed by Lowe
   became influential around the world, Great Britain, France, even Brazil
   offered him the position of major-general if he were to organize a
   balloon corps for them. Having had enough of war, he declined the
   offer, but he did send them a balloon with equipment including portable
   generators. He consulted with their military experts and recruited his
   best aeronauts, the Allen brothers, to assist them.^[135][28]

   During his Civil War days, Lowe had met a German youth nosing around
   the army balloon camp. The young man’s name was Count [136]Ferdinand
   von Zeppelin, who shared his own fascination with aeronautics. General
   McClellan had put all balloon ride-alongs off limits, so Lowe sent von
   Zeppelin to [137]Poolesville to visit with his German assistant
   aeronaut John Steiner who could entertain the lad in his own language.
   Von Zeppelin returned in the 1870s to interview Lowe on all of his
   aeronautic techniques. Count von Zeppelin later designed the dirigible
   aircraft that bore his name.^[138][29]

   Lowe made a new home in [139]Norristown, Pennsylvania where he
   continued with his scientific endeavors with hydrogen gas, improving
   upon and patenting the [140]water gas process by which high volumes of
   the volatile fuel could be made from passing steam over hot coal. The
   industry revolutionized home heating and lighting along the eastern
   seaboard. He held several patents on [141]ice making machines,
   including his perfected “Compression Ice Machine” which would
   revolutionize the cold storage industry. He even discovered that gas
   burning through a platinum [142]mantle produced a bright illumination
   (as later found in the [143]Coleman [144]lantern).^[145][30]

   He bought an old steamship in which he installed his refrigerating
   units and began shipping fresh fruit from New York to Galveston, and
   fresh beef back. This was an historical first where people were able to
   eat fresh beef that hadn't been packed in preservative salts. His
   steamship venture failed due to his lack of knowledge about shipping,
   but the industry was picked up by several other countries.

   Lowe also manufactured products that ran on hydrogen gas. With these
   and his several patents, Lowe amassed a fortune. For his achievements,
   Lowe received the coveted [146]Elliott Cresson Medal for the Invention
   Held to be Most Useful to Mankind.^[147][31]

[[148]edit] Lowe's gas process

   In 1873, Lowe developed and patented the [149]water gas process by
   which large amounts of [150]hydrogen gas could be generated for
   residential and commercial use in heating and lighting. Unlike the
   common [151]coal gas, or [152]coke gas which was used in municipal
   service, this gas provided a more efficient heating fuel. The process
   used the [153]water gas shift reaction:

          CO + H[2]O → CO[2] + H[2]

   The process was discovered by the passing of high-pressure steam over
   hot [154]coal, the major source of coke gas. Lowe's process improved
   upon the chimney systems by which the coal could remain superheated
   thereby maintaining a consistently high supply of the gas. This process
   created a thermo-chemical reaction of applying hydrogen, in the steam,
   to [155]carbon monoxide, in the coke gas. The reaction produced carbon
   dioxide and pure hydrogen which after a process of cooling and
   "scrubbing," passing through [156]water vapor, left just a pure
   hydrogen gas.

   The process spurred on the industry of gas manufacturing, and
   [157]gasification plants were established quickly along the Eastern
   seaboard of the United States. Similar processes, like the [158]Haber
   Process, led to the manufacture of [159]ammonia (NH[3]) by the
   combining of [160]nitrogen, found in [161]air, with high volumes of
   hydrogen. This spurred on the [162]refrigeration industry which long
   used ammonia as its [163]refrigerant. Prof. Lowe also held several
   patents on artificial ice making machines, and was able to run
   successful businesses in cold storage as well as products which
   operated on hydrogen gas.

[[164]edit] Retirement in Pasadena, California

   In 1887, Lowe moved to Los Angeles and in 1890 to [165]Pasadena,
   California, where he built a 24,000 square foot (2200 m^2) mansion. He
   started a water-gas company, founded the Citizens Bank of Los Angeles,
   established several ice plants, and bought a Pasadena [166]opera house.

[[167]edit] Mount Lowe Railway

   Great Incline of the Mount Lowe Railway on opening day, July 4, 1893.
   The band went up first playing "Nearer My God to Thee."

   Early Pasadenans always had a dream of a scenic mountain railroad to
   the crest of the [168]San Gabriel Mountains. It was one [169]David J.
   Macpherson, a civil engineer graduate of Cornell University, who had
   the general plans for just such a railroad. He was introduced to Prof.
   Lowe with the idea of joining Macpherson’s plans and Lowe’s money
   together in one venture.

   In 1891, Lowe and Macpherson incorporated the Pasadena & Mount Wilson
   Railroad (later the [170]Mount Lowe Railway^[171][32]). Unable to
   obtain all the rights of way to [172]Mt. Wilson, the two men redirected
   their railway toward Oak Mountain via the Echo promontory. The
   difference between this and any other scenic mountain railway of its
   kind was that it was an all-electric traction [173]trolley (streetcar),
   the only one of its kind to ever exist. Oak Mountain was later renamed
   [174]Mount Lowe, and to make it official, [175]Andrew McNally, the
   co-founder of the map printing company [176]Rand McNally who had moved
   to [177]Altadena, had the name Mt. Lowe printed on all his maps.

   Lowe opened the first section of the railway on July 4, 1893, from the
   corner of Lake and Calaveras in Altadena to the Rubio Pavilion in the
   Rubio Canyon, then transferring to a steep 2,800-foot (850 m)long
   [178]funicular to [179]Echo Mountain. At the top there was a 40-room
   chalet. In 1894, he added an 80-room hotel, the Echo Mountain House,
   and the observatory. By 1896, the upper division was finished into
   Grand Canyon at Ye Alpine Tavern. Altogether there were some seven
   miles (11.265 km) of track. Lowe lost the venture to receivership in
   1899, which left him impoverished. The MLR became part of [180]Henry
   Huntington's recently formed [181]Pacific Electric Railway (also known
   as "Red Car") in 1902.

   The only part of the railway property that remained Lowe's was the
   observatory on Echo Mountain. It boasted a 16-inch (406.4 mm)
   reflective [182]telescope from which many [183]astronomical finds were
   made. It was blown down in a gale in 1928. The railway fell in stages
   to the Echo Mountain House fire, a kitchen fire on February 4, 1900; a
   wind-aided brush fire on Echo Mountain in 1905, which wiped out
   everything except the observatory and the astronomer's cabin; a Rubio
   Canyon flash flood in 1909 that destroyed the Pavilion; and an
   electrical fire that razed the Tavern in 1936. The line was abandoned
   after the Los Angeles deluge of March 1938.

[[184]edit] Death and legacy

   Lowe died at his daughter's [185]Pasadena, California home at age 81
   after a few years of failing health. Lowe was buried at Mountain View
   Cemetery in Altadena, California, Next to him lies his wife Leontine,
   who died a year later. Also buried near the Lowe monument are his two
   sons, Leon and Sobieski, and other family members whose names differ
   due to the married names of the seven daughters. Many of the family
   members returned to the East Coast. A nearby monument has been
   separately erected for his son Thaddeus and his wife.^[186][33]
   Thaddeus Lowe's granddaughter [187]Pancho Lowe Barnes was also an
   aviation pioneer.

   The Mount Lowe Railway was placed on the [188]National Register of
   Historic Places on January 6, 1993. The mountain itself still bears his
   name. Lowe is a member of the U.S. Army [189]Military Intelligence Hall
   of Fame.

   [190]Lowe Army Heliport at [191]Fort Rucker, Alabama is named in his
   honor.

[[192]edit] Thaddeus Lowe in popular culture

   Lowe was portrayed by [193]Stuart Whitman in the movie High Flying Spy
   in 1972, produced by Walt Disney Production

    2. [196]^ Block, p.12.
    3. [197]^ Hoehling, Mary, ‘’Thaddeus Lowe America’s One-Man Air
       Corps’’, pp. 9-10.
    4. [198]^ Block, p. 15.
    5. [199]^ Both Block and Hoehling talk about Lowe laying belly down in
       front of a “pine knot stoked fire.”
    6. [200]^ Block, pp. 15-16.
    7. [201]^ Hoehling, p. 29. Lowe assumed the more euphonious name of
       Coulincourt in place of Constantine.

    9. [203]^ Hoehling, p. 35.
   10. [204]^ Hoehling, p. 38
   11. [205]^ Note the title “Professor” now applied to Lowe’s name is
       officially derived from newspaper reports who give creditable
       scientists such an appellation.
   12. [206]^ Hoehling, p. 59.

   15. [209]^ Block, p.49.
   16. [210]^ Block, p.37.
   17. [211]^ Both Block and Hoehling wrote that Lowe was taken into
       custody as a Union spy. Mary Hoehling entitled her chapter on this
       subject, First Prisoner of War. Many people consider Lowe as having
       been taken prisoner of war in this incident. The technicality is
       that POW’s are military people captured in a military action by
       opposing military forces. Lowe was a civilian balloonist captured
       by a mob of town folk and was subsequently being detained as a
       possible Union spy. Spies are not military people, and are subject
       to summary execution. It’s much different than being a prisoner of
       war.
   18. [212]^ Hoehling, pp. 91-94.
   19. [213]^ Hoehling, pp. 107-108.
   20. [214]^ Lowe’s Official Report to the Secretary of War relates all
       the incidents and transmittals concerning the organization of the
       Balloon Corps including the expected receipt of commissions which
       were never forthcoming.

   32. [228]^ All text on the Mount Lowe Railway is summarized from Mount
       Lowe: the Railway in the Clouds, Charles Seims.
   33. [229]^ The Altadena Historical Society, Altadena Heritage, and the
       Pasadena Historical Museum have all put on "cemetery tours" at
       Mountain View Cemetery by which many of the interred personalities
       are resurrected in the form of an actor-impersonator who stands by
       the grave sites and relates stories of the celebrity in the first
       person. Mike Manning of [230]Magi Media has been regarded as the
       only impersonator to accurately portray Professor Lowe.
