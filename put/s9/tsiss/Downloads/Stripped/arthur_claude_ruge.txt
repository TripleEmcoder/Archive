   Arthur Claude Ruge (pronounced ROO-gee) (July 28, 1905 – April 3, 2000)
   was an American mechanical engineer and inventor who developed and
   pioneered the modern bonded wire resistance [9]strain gauge.^[10][1]

[[17]edit] Background

   Ruge graduated from [18]Carnegie Mellon University with a mechanical
   engineering degree in 1925, and worked as a structural engineer for
   several years thereafter. He then earned his master's degree in civil
   engineering and a doctorate in engineering seismology from [19]MIT. In
   1932, Ruge joined the faculty of MIT^1, where he would spend the rest
   of his academic career, becoming America's first professor of
   engineering seismology^2.

[[20]edit] Seismology

   The [21]1933 Long Beach earthquake gave Ruge a new direction ^3. The
   disaster had proved the importance of [22]earthquake engineering.
   Buildings that had been appropriately engineered and reinforced
   sustained little to no structural damage, while the rest of Long Beach
   suffered catastrophic ruin. Ruge turned the focus of his research to
   the development of earthquake-resistant architecture, specifically a
   method to provide seismic insulation for water towers. In his lab at
   MIT, Ruge and his research assistant constructed a hydraulic shake
   table that simulated the effects of the Long Beach earthquake; on this
   table they placed a replica of a water tower ^4. It was this research,
   and the need to measure stress caused by earthquakes that eventually
   led to Ruge's invention of the strain gauge.

[[23]edit] Invention of the Strain Gauge

   During the course of his seismic insulation research, Ruge discovered
   that he needed to measure the stress on the water tanks that was caused
   by the earthquakes, and so he set about devising a means for attaining
   this measurement. According to Ruge, he had a [24]Eureka moment on
   April 3, 1938 when “the invention just popped into my mind, whole. I
   could see it clearly and knew that it would work.” His solution was to
   glue a piece of cigarette paper on the tank and glue a small wire with
   end connections to the paper ^4. Ruge and his assistants quickly
   developed this rudimentary device [25][1] into the more advanced
   version that would later be patented.

   Barnaby Feder writes:

     The SR-4 was a deceptively simple invention composed of four thin
     tungsten filaments, similar to those used in light bulbs, glued
     together in the shape of a diamond. When an electrical current is
     run across the wires, no voltage can be measured as long as they
     remain perfectly aligned. But if some force disturbs the symmetry,
     and thus the resistance in the wires, the gauge puts out a voltage
     proportional to the force.^[26][1]

   When MIT released the right to Ruge's invention, saying that, while
   “interesting,” the strain gauge didn’t show much potential, he
   immediately went about commercializing it. Only then did he discover
   that his strain gauge had already been invented the year before by
   [27]Edward E. Simmons, an electrical engineer at [28]Caltech. Though
   the Simmons was the first to invent the resistance wire strain gauge,
   both men are credited with the discovery and share the original patent.
   The trade name of the device, SR-4, which stands for “Simmons Ruge – 4
   people,” acknowledges both men and indicates that four people (Simmons,
   Ruge and their respective assistants) were responsible for its
   realization^5.

[[29]edit] Founding of a Company

   In 1939, Arthur Ruge and Alfred deForest, a colleague from MIT and
   fellow inventor, founded a company, Ruge Consulting, that pioneered and
   manufactured the SR-4 and continued to innovate new, related
   technologies. They produced the first commercial shipment of strain
   gages – a 50,000-piece order in 1941 [30][2] ^6. In 1955,
   [31]Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton bought the Ruge Consulting and rights to the
   SR-4 strain gage and renamed the company BLH Electronics Inc. A new
   company, [32]RdF Corporation was formed to continue development and
   manufacturing of temperature sensors. The name RdF is short for Ruge
   and deForest.
