   William Alexander Spinks, Jr. (1865–1933), known professionally as
   William A. Spinks or (in the initialing practice common in his era) W.
   A. Spinks, and occasionally also referred to as Billy Spinks^[30][1]),
   was an [31]American professional player of [32]carom billiards in the
   late 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition to being amateur
   [33]Pacific Coast Billiards Champion several
   times,^[34][2]^[35][3]^[36][4] a world champion contender in more than
   one [37]cue sports discipline,^[38][5] and an exhibition player in
   Europe,^[39][6] he became the co-inventor (with [40]William Hoskins) in
   1897 of modern [41]billiard cue chalk.^[42][6]^[43][7] He was
   originally (and again in retirement from the billiards circuit) a
   [44]Californian, but spent much of his professional career in
   [45]Chicago, Illinois.^[46][2]^[47][6] At his peak, his was a household
   name in U.S. billiards;^[48][8] the [49]New York Times labeled Spinks
   "[one] of the most brilliant players among the veterans of the
   game",^[50][9] and he still holds the world record for points scored in
   a row (1,010) using a particular shot type.^[51][3]^[52][10]^:289 Aside
   from his billiards playing career, he founded a lucrative sporting
   goods manufacturing business, and was both an oil company investor and
   director, and a flower and fruit farm operator and [53]horticulturist,
   originator of the eponymous Spinks [54]cultivar of [55]avocado.

[[66]edit] As an inventor (1892–97)

   While Spinks was a world-class player, his lasting contribution to
   [67]cue sports was the innovations he brought to the game and the
   industry resulting from his fascination with the [68]abrasives used by
   players on the leather [69]tips of their [70]cue sticks.

   [71]Cue "chalk" (used since at least 1807) helps the tip better grip
   the [72]cue ball (very briefly) on a [73]stroke and prevents
   [74]miscueing, as well as permitting the player to impart a great deal
   more [75]spin to the ball, vital for [76]position play and for
   spin-intensive shots, such as [77]massés. In the 1800s, [78]true chalk
   (generally calcium carbonate^[79][10]^:46 lumps, suspended from
   strings), and even [80]plaster^[81][10]^:46 was often used, but players
   experimented with other powdery, abrasive
   substances,^[82][2]^[83][10]^:46 since true chalk had a deleterious
   effect on the game equipment,^[84][10]^:46 not only discoloring the
   billiard cloth but also allegedly actually causing damage to the
   fabric.^[85][11]

   In 1892, Spinks was particularly impressed by a piece of natural
   chalk-like substance obtained in France, and presented it to chemist
   and electrical engineer William Hoskins (1862–1934)^[86][12] of Chicago
   for analysis, who determined it was porous [87]volcanic rock
   ([88]pumice) originally probably from [89]Mount Etna, Sicily. Using the
   rock as a starting place, the two experimented together with different
   formulations of various materials to achieve the cue ball "[90]action"
   that Spinks sought.^[91][6]

   1900–1910, note the endorsement by World Champion [93]Jacob Schaefer,
   Sr., often Spinks's opponent as a touring pro

   They eventually narrowed their search to a mixture of
   Illinois-sourced^[94][6] [95]silica and the abrasive substance
   [96]corundum or aloxite^[97][7] (a form of [98]aluminum oxide,
   Al[2]O[3]),^[99][13]^[100][14]^[101][15] founding William A. Spinks &
   Company with a factory^[102][2] in Chicago^[103][6] after securing a
   patent on March 9, 1897.^[104][7] Spinks himself later left the company
   as an active party, which retained his name and was subsequently run by
   Hoskins, and later by Hoskins's cousin^[105][6] Edmund F.
   Hoskin,^[106][16] after Hoskins moved on to other projects.

   While regular calcium carbonate chalk had been packaged and marketed on
   a local scale by various parties (English player [107]Jack Carr's
   "Twisting Powder" of the 1820s being the earliest recorded example,
   although considered dubious by some billiards
   researchers),^[108][10]^:46 the Spinks Company product (which is still
   emulated by modern manufacturers with differing, proprietary
   compounds)^[109][10]^:46 effectively revolutionized
   billiards.^[110][11] The modern product provided a cue tip friction
   enhancer that allowed the tip to better grip the cue ball
   briefly^[111][7] and impart a previously unattainable amount of spin on
   the ball, which consequently allowed more precise and extreme [112]cue
   ball control, made miscueing less likely, made [113]curve and
   [114]massé shots more plausible, and ultimately spawned the new cue
   sport of [115]artistic billiards. Even the basic [116]draw and
   [117]follow shots of [118]pool games (such as [119]eight-ball and
   [120]nine-ball) depend heavily on the effects and properties of modern
   billiard "chalk".

   Spinks made a "fortune"^[121][2]^[122][3]^[123][17] from his
   co-invention and the company that sold it to the world.

[[124]edit] As a player

   Spinks was a formidable specialist and professional competitor in
   [125]straight rail billiards (early on), and [126]balkline billiards
   (arguably the most difficult of all cue sports aside from [127]artistic
   billiards), especially 14.2 and later 18.2 balkline, and skilled enough
   at the even more difficult 18.1 variant to hold his own against World
   Champions.

[[128]edit] 1890s: Rise as a professional contender

   He began his competitive professional playing career in [129]Brooklyn,
   New York,^[130][18] ca. 1892,^[131][19] at about 27 years of age.
   [132]Image: A black-on-white line drawing illustrating the shot,
   described in detail in the caption; text below the drawing reads: "Fig.
   1—Spink's exhibition masse, four times on cushion and carom in corner
   on two balls."
   An extreme [133]massé shot by Spinks during an 1893 exhibition game
   against [134]Jacob Schaefer, Sr. Starting from bottom left, his
   [135]cue ball swerves into and [136]caroms off one [137]object ball,
   then due to its extreme [138]spin rebounds into the same [139]cushion
   four times before finally rolling away for a perfect, scoring hit on
   the other ball. Spinks actually lost this game.^[140][18]

   On December 19, 1893 in Brooklyn, Spinks played in an [141]exhibition
   that also featured the great [142]Maurice Daly and young champion
   [143]Frank Ives, and gave demonstrations of fancy [144]massé shots (see
   illustration). He also played a 14.2 balkline match against World
   Champion [145]Jacob Schaefer, Sr.; Schaefer won, 250–162, with a high
   [146]run and average of 88 and 20 (respectively) to Spinks's 33 and
   13.^[147][18]

   In 1894, he was living in [148]Cincinnati, Ohio, and in January of that
   year offered a convoluted challenge to veteran [149]cueist [150]Edward
   McLaughlin of [151]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to play him either a
   single 14.2 match to 600 [152]points for US$500 each (a substantial
   amount of money in that period for someone to put up personally on a
   bet – approximately $11,800 in 2009 dollars)^[153][20] in [154]New York
   City, or one in New York and one in Philadelphia, or one in Cincinnati
   and one in Philadelphia, whatever McLaughlin preferred, and even
   offered to pay travel expenses to Cincinnati.^[155][21]

   Spinks issued an even more curious challenge in November 1894, to play
   14.2 balkline against (almost) any challenger to 600 points for a
   $1,000 pot again, and while including French champion [156]Edward
   Fournil, the bet specifically excluded the top-three names in that era
   of the sport, namely Shaefer, Ives and [157]George Franklin
   Slosson.^[158][22] The challenge was accepted by well-known Chicago pro
   [159]Thomas Gallagher (in a match that future champion [160]Ora
   Morningstar traveled all the way to Chicago to
   see).^[161][23]^[162][24]

   Spinks was apparently not a fan of upstart cueist Ives in particular.
   Days after issuing his caveat-laden challenge, Spinks was described by
   an onlooking journalist as "very uneasy until the seventeenth inning"
   as a spectator at the 14.2 balkline World Champion challenge [163]match
   between Ives and incumbent Schaefer; the latter's point total had been
   trailing, sometimes badly, in all sixteen previous [164]innings until
   he rallied in the final inning of the [165]game.^[166][25] Spinks,
   along with Gallagher, even helped Schaefer train in 14.2 for another
   match against Ives, in October of that year; though Spinks lost this
   practice match 600–369 (averages 23 vs. 14), he had a high [167]run of
   109, to Schaefer's 102 (and Gallagher's 157 total).^[168][26]

   Spinks was reported in the press in 1895 to be specifically desired as
   a competitor in an upcoming seven-man invitational tournament for
   "second class" professional players (i.e., not the top 3), organized by
   Daly, and with as much as $1,200 (approx. $30,500 in 2009
   dollars)^[169][20] [170]added. ^[171][27]

   Spinks had moved to Chicago by 1896,^[172][28] and was perfecting his
   billiard chalk with Hoskins. That year he was noted for besting
   McLaughlin at 14.2 by a comfortable 2500–2300 margin (with averages of
   11 vs. 10) in a five-evening, $250 (approx. $6360, in 2009
   dollars)^[173][20] 14.2 match, December 8–12, in Slosson's New York
   City [174]billiard hall. At one point he had trailed rather badly,
   1500–1880, after McLaughlin pulled off a stunning run of 140 (Spinks's
   highest recorded run of the match was
   69).^[175][29]^[176][30]^[177][31]^[178][32]^[179][33]^[180][34]

   By 1897, the year of the launch of Spinks & Company, he had evidently
   overcome his seeming reluctance to face World Champions again (perhaps
   from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes).
   Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open
   tournament.^[181][35]

   The next month in New York City, a January 15–21, 1898
   [182]double-elimination, five-man invitational 18.2 balkline tournament
   was arranged, again in Chicago. It was a [183]handicapped event,
   featuring the five top players from the previous event – Schaefer and
   Ives, as World Champions, had to reach 600 points to Spinks's,
   [184]William Catton's and [185]George Sutton's 260.^[186][36] Without
   having to rely on the 600-point handicap, Spinks beat Schaefer
   flat-out, 260–139 (with a high [187]run of 48 vs. Schaefer's 38) in his
   January 18 second game.^[188][37] Spinks (with a high run of "only" 44)
   was himself defeated in a very close 249–260 third game a day later by
   Catton (high run 56) – by way of comparison, the same night Ives
   trounced Sutton by a whopping 400–160.^[189][38] By January 20, Spinks
   seemed to be running out of steam, as Sutton took him 260–118, (high
   runs 73 vs. 30),^[190][39] and he lost again 154–400 (with another high
   run of 44) to Ives a day later. (In Spinks's defense, he not only did
   better against Ives than Catton had, but Ives also had a very
   impressive high run of 136, making it virtually impossible to catch
   up.) This loss put Spinks out of the tournament at 4th place.^[191][40]

[[192]edit] 1900s: World-class competitor

   Spinks was still considered a newsworthy contender over a decade later,
   for the World 18.2 Balkline Championship of 1909, being enumerated in
   "a fine list of entries" anticipated for the March event.^[193][8]

   On January 11, Spinks (with a high run of 51) beat former amateur
   champion and then-pro [194]Calvin Demarest, 250–199, in only 15
   innings, despite scoring 0 points in 4 innings and only 1 point in
   another, by building several solid runs in the innings in which things
   went his way. For all intents and purposes it was a 10-inning
   win.^[195][41] Demarest took his revenge only days later, defeating
   Spinks in a close 250–225, 23-inning game on January 13, despite
   Spinks's high run of 78 (his highest 18.2 run on record in
   publicly-available sources, and considerably higher than Demarest's 52
   that night).^[196][42] Spinks lost to him again the very next day,
   175–250, in an [197]exhibition game, despite Spinks's solid high run of
   69, and also beat veteran pro Tom
   Gallagher.^[198][9]^[[199]clarification needed]

   In January 1909, just prior to an 18.1 balkline championship at Madison
   Square Garden (in which Spinks was not competing), he and [200]Mauricy
   Daly were observed playing practice games with Sutton for the latter's
   pre-event training, in Daly's [201]billiard hall in New York City, on
   multiple occasions over a several-day stretch. While Spinks lost all
   but one of the recorded matches of this series, one loss was by a hair,
   at 400–399, another was 400–370, and his victory was a surprising
   300–194 – and 18.1 was not his preferred
   game.^[202][43]^[203][44]^[204][45]^[205][46]^[206][47]

   Many articles of the era stress that Spinks was a Californian, because
   during this period American billiards was completely dominated by
   [207]East-Coasters and a few [208]Midwesterners.^[209][5]

[[210]edit] 1910s–1920s: Setting a record and leveling the field

   Spinks was noted in 1912 for a still-unbroken world record [211]run of
   1,010 continuous points at 18.2 balkline using the "[212]chuck nurse"
   (a form of [213]nurse shot), and could have made more, but
   stopped,^[214][3]^[215][10]^:52, 289 before [216]anchor space rules
   were instituted especially to curtail the effectiveness of the chuck
   nurse.^[217][10]^:8^[218][48] The use of such repetitive, predictable
   shots by Spinks, Schaefer Sr. and their contemporaries led to the
   development of the more advanced and restrictive 14.1 balkline rules
   (invented in 1907, but not played professionally until 1914), which
   further thwarted the ease of reliance on nurse shots than the older
   balkline games already did.^[219][10]^:15–16

   In August 1915, Spinks was tapped to join a consultative panel of
   notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a
   new handicapping system for balkline billiards, organized by the
   [220]Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, at that time the organizers of
   the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply
   making it possible for the newly ascendant [221]Willie Hoppe to be
   meaningfully challenged (his near-unassailability was hurting billiard
   tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by
   many potential ticket-buyers), although the system was expected to
   level the playing field in other ways, especially making it easier for
   skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.^[222][49]

   Well into the 1920s, Spinks was still a well-respected figure in the
   billiards industry, and wrote articles for publications such as
   Billiards Magazine, in which he sometimes focused on rather esoteric
   topics such as in his January 1923 piece on "Ventilation of Billiard
   Rooms".^[223][50]

[[224]edit] As an oilman

   [225]Wiki letter w cropped.svg This section requires [226]expansion.

   Spinks described himself as a director of an oil company as of
   1900.^[227][2]^[228][51] He invested money from his billiard equipment
   corporation in the [229]petroleum industry in California.^[230][4]

[[231]edit] As a farm operator

   While Spinks was not operating a farm as of 1900,^[232][51] the W. A.
   Spinks Ranch was a large enough operation by 1909 to employ a staff of
   farmhands, and included land in [233]Bradbury Canyon, near [234]Duarte,
   California, where Spinks resided at the time.^[235][52] He described
   himself as a flower farmer (among other such specialists in the area)
   in 1910,^[236][53] and later as an "avocado
   rancher".^[237][2]^[238][54] As a [239]pomology
   horticulturist,^[240][4] he developed the Spinks avocado
   cultivar.^[241][55] Spinks was active in the growers' community, and in
   1922 hosted a large regional farm bureau meeting of avocado farmers at
   his ranchland "mountain estate".^[242][56] As a [243]floriculturist,
   Spinks made no known major contributions.

[[244]edit] The Spinks avocado

   In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a [245]University
   of California at Berkeley and [246]California Avocado Association
   comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be
   more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also proved to be
   the second-longest lasting in storage of the ten varieties
   tested.^[247][57]

   Considered "famous"^[248][56]^[249][58] by 1918, the Duarte-based
   Spinks avocado orchards were contracted to supply seedlings in 1919 for
   the palace of [250]Xu Shichang, the [251]President of China before
   Communism, and other prestigious gardens in Asia.^[252][58]

[[253]edit] Private life

   William A. Spinks, Jr., the youngest of five children, was born July
   11, 1865 in the then-small township of [254]San Jose, California, to
   struggling farmer William Sr. and wife Cynthia J. (Prather) Spinks. He
   had blue eyes, dark hair and a ruddy complexion, and was 5 feet
   8 inches (1.73 m) tall by
   adulthood.^[255][59]^[256][60]^[257][61]^[258][62] His education is
   obscure.^[259][63]

   his mouth, but it is not part of the original photograph.

   On September 1, 1891 he married Clara Alexandria Karlson (b. December
   12, 1871, [261]Gothenburg, Sweden, immigrated 1872; d. October 4, 1949,
   [262]Los Angeles); they were to remain together for over 40 years. They
   returned to California from Chicago before the turn of the century.
   After a period in a San Francisco apartment (ca. 1900), they lived in
   the then-rural Los Angeles suburbs of Duarte (ca. 1910) where their
   farm was, and [263]Monrovia (later, by 1920) where they maintained a
   modest house. After William's business success, the couple became
   extensive world
   travelers.^[264][51]^[265][53]^[266][54]^[267][60]^[268][64]^[269][65]

   William Spinks died January 15, 1933, aged 67, in Monrovia,
   California.^[270][2]^[271][3] In [272]Los Angeles County's [273]San
   Gabriel Valley, Spinks Canyon, its stream Spinks Canyon Creek, and the
   local major residential thoroughfare Spinks Canyon Road (running
   through Duarte's northernmost residential area, Duarte Mesa), are named
   after him.^[274][66]
