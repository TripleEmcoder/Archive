                      Elisha Gray
      Born    August 2, 1835(1835-08-02)
              [7]Barnesville, [8]Ohio, U.S.
      Died    January 21, 1901(1901-01-21) (aged 65)
              [9]Newtonville, [10]Massachusetts, U.S.
   Occupation Engineer/Inventor
     Awards   [11]Elliott Cresson Medal (1897)

   Elisha Gray (August 2, 1835 – January 21, 1901) was an American
   [12]electrical engineer who co-founded the [13]Western Electric
   Manufacturing Company. Gray is best known for his [14]development of a
   telephone prototype in 1876 in [15]Highland Park, Illinois and is
   considered by some writers^[16][1] to be the true inventor of the
   variable resistance telephone, despite losing out to [17]Alexander
   Graham Bell for the [18]telephone patent.

   Gray is also considered to be the father of the modern [19]music
   synthesizer,^[20][2] and was awarded over 70 patents for his
   inventions.^[21][3]

[[30]edit] Biography and early inventions

   Born into a [31]Quaker family in [32]Barnesville, Ohio, Gray was
   brought up on a farm. He spent several years at [33]Oberlin College
   where he experimented with electrical devices. Although Gray was not a
   graduate of Oberlin College, he taught electricity and science at
   Oberlin and built laboratory equipment for Oberlin science departments.

   In 1862 while at Oberlin, Gray met and married Delia Minerva Shepard.

   In 1865 Gray invented a self-adjusting [34]telegraph relay that
   automatically adapted to varying insulation of the telegraph line.

   In 1867 Gray received a patent for the self-adjusting telegraph relay
   and in later years he received patents for more than 70 other
   inventions.

   In 1869, Elisha Gray and his partner Enos M. Barton founded Gray &
   Barton Co. in Cleveland, Ohio to supply telegraph equipment to the
   giant [35]Western Union Telegraph Company. The electrical distribution
   business was later spun off from Western Electric and organized into a
   separate company, [36]Graybar Electric Company, Inc.. Barton had been
   employed by [37]Western Union to examine and test new products.

   In 1870 financing for Gray & Barton Co. was arranged by [38]General
   Anson Stager, a superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company.
   Stager became an active partner in Gray & Barton Co., which moved to
   Chicago. Gray moved from Ohio to [39]Highland Park near Chicago and
   remained on the board of directors. But he gave up his administrative
   position as chief engineer to focus on inventions that could benefit
   the telegraph industry. Gray's inventions and patent costs were
   financed by a dentist, Dr. Samuel S. White of Philadelphia, who had
   made a fortune producing porcelain teeth. White wanted Gray to focus on
   the [40]acoustic telegraph which promised huge profits to the exclusion
   of what appeared to be unpromising competing inventions such as the
   telephone. It was White's decision in 1876 to abandon Gray's caveat for
   the telephone.

   In 1870, Gray developed a needle annunciator for hotels and another for
   elevators. He also developed a telegraph printer which had a typewriter
   keyboard and printed messages on paper tape.

   In 1872 [41]Western Union, then financed by the Vanderbilts and [42]J.
   P. Morgan, bought one-third of Gray and Barton Co. and changed the name
   to [43]Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago. Gray
   continued to invent for Western Electric.

   In 1874, Gray retired to do independent research and development. Gray
   applied for a patent on a harmonic telegraph which consisted of
   multi-tone transmitters, each tone being controlled by a separate
   telegraph key. Gray gave several private demonstrations of this
   invention in New York and Washington, D.C. in May and June 1874.

   Gray was a charter member of the [44]Presbyterian Church in Highland
   Park, Illinois. At the church, on December 29, 1874, Gray gave the
   first public demonstration of his invention for transmitting musical
   tones and transmitted "familiar melodies through telegraph wire"
   according to a newspaper announcement. This was the first electric
   music [45]synthesizer using self vibrating electromagnetic circuits
   that were single-note oscillators operated by a two-octave piano
   keyboard. The "Musical Telegraph" used steel reeds whose oscillations
   were created by electromagnets and transmitted over a telegraph wire.
   Gray also built a simple loudspeaker in later models consisting of a
   vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator tones
   audible and louder at the receiving end. In 1900 before Gray's death he
   was working on an underwater signaling device, when officers were
   investigating his house after his death they gave the invention in to
   Oberlin College and some of the students were testing it out. After a
   few years of testing he was recognised as the inventor of the
   underwater signaling device.

   On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted patent 166,096 for "Electric
   Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones" ([46]acoustic telegraphy).

[[47]edit] Elisha Gray and the telephone

   Further information: [48]Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone
   controversy

   Because of Samuel White's^[49][4] opposition to Gray working on the
   telephone, Gray did not tell anybody about his new invention for
   transmitting voice sounds until Friday 11 February 1876 when Gray
   requested that his patent lawyer William D. Baldwin prepare a "caveat"
   for filing at the US Patent Office. A [50]caveat was like a provisional
   patent application with drawings and description but without claims.
   Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander
   Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, demonstrating their
   surprising similarity.

   On the morning of Monday 14 February [51]1876, Gray signed and had
   notarized the caveat that described a telephone that used a liquid
   microphone. Baldwin then submitted the caveat to the US Patent Office.
   That same morning a lawyer for [52]Alexander Graham Bell submitted
   Bell's patent application.

   Which application arrived first is hotly disputed, although the most
   recent evidence suggest Gray's caveat arrived a few hours before Bell's
   application.^[53][5] Bell's lawyers in Washington, DC had been waiting
   with Bell's patent application for months, under instructions not to
   file it in the USA until it had been filed in Britain first. (At the
   time, Britain would only issue patents on discoveries not previously
   patented elsewhere.)

   During the weekend of February 12–14, 1876, before either caveat or
   application had been filed in the patent office, Bell's lawyer learned
   about the liquid transmitter idea in Gray's caveat that would be filed
   early Monday morning February 14.^[54][5] Bell's lawyer then added
   seven sentences describing the liquid transmitter and a variable
   resistance claim to Bell's draft application. After the lawyer's clerk
   recopied the draft as a finished patent application, Bell's lawyer
   hand-delivered the finished application to the patent office just
   before noon on Monday, a few hours after Gray's caveat was delivered to
   the patent office by Gray's lawyer. Bell's lawyer requested that Bell's
   application be immediately recorded and hand-delivered to the examiner
   on Monday so that later Bell could claim it had arrived first. Bell was
   in Boston at this time and was not aware that his application had been
   filed in the US patent office.^[55][6]

   Five days later, on February 19, Zenas Fisk Wilber, the patent examiner
   for both Bell's application and Gray's caveat, noticed that Bell's
   application claimed the same variable resistance feature described in
   Gray's caveat. Wilber declared an interference that would delay Bell's
   application until Bell submitted proof, under the [56]first to invent
   rules, that Bell had invented that feature before Gray.^[57][7] Bell's
   lawyer telegraphed Bell, who was still in Boston, to come to Washington
   DC. When Bell arrived on February 26, Bell visited his lawyers and then
   visited examiner Wilber who told Bell that Gray's caveat showed a
   liquid transmitter and asked Bell for proof that the liquid transmitter
   idea (described in Bell's patent application as using mercury as the
   liquid) was invented by Bell. Bell pointed to an application of Bell's
   filed a year earlier where mercury was used in a circuit breaker. The
   examiner accepted this argument, although mercury would not have worked
   in a telephone transmitter. On March 3, Wilber approved Bell's
   application and on March 7, 1876 patent 174,465 was published by the
   [58]U.S. Patent Office.

   Bell returned to Boston and resumed work on March 9, drawing a diagram
   in his lab notebook of a water transmitter being used face down and
   very similar to that shown in Gray's caveat."^[59][8] Bell and Watson
   built and tested Gray's water transmitter design on 10 March and
   successfully transmitted clear speech saying "Mr. Watson -- come here
   -- I want to see you." Bell's notebooks did not become public until the
   1990s.^[60][9]

   The importance of Bell's test of Gray's water transmitter idea was it
   proved that clear speech could be transmitted electrically. It was a
   scientific experiment, not development of a commercial product. Prior
   to that, Bell had only an unproven theory.

   Although Gray had abandoned his caveat, Gray applied for a patent for
   the same invention in late 1877. This put him in a second interference
   with Bell's patents. The [61]Patent Office determined "while Gray was
   undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the [variable
   resistance] invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his
   failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had
   demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to
   have it considered."^[62][10] Gray challenged Bell's patent anyway, and
   after two years of litigation, Bell was awarded rights to the
   invention, and as a result, Bell is credited as the inventor.

   In 1886, the patent examiner (Zenas Fisk Wilber) stated in a sworn
   affidavit^[63][11] that he was an alcoholic and deeply in debt to
   Bell's lawyer [64]Marcellus Bailey with whom Wilber had served in the
   Civil War. Wilber stated that, contrary to Patent Office rules, he
   showed Bailey the caveat Gray had filed. Wilber also stated that he
   showed the caveat to Bell and Bell gave him $100. Bell testified that
   they only discussed the patent in general terms, although in a letter
   to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details.

   Bell's patent was also disputed in 1888 by attorney Lysander Hill who
   accused Wilber of allowing Bell or his lawyer Pollok to add a
   handwritten margin note of 7 sentences to Bell's application that
   describe an alternate design similar to Gray's liquid microphone
   design.^[65][12] However, the marginal note was added only to Bell's
   earlier draft, not as a marginal addition to his patent application
   that shows the 7 sentences already present in a paragraph in Bell's
   patent application when it was filed in the Patent Office on February
   14, 1876. Bell testified that he added those 7 sentences in the margin
   of an earlier draft of his application "almost at the last moment
   before sending it off to Washington" to his lawyers. Bell or his lawyer
   could not have added the 7 sentences to the application after it was
   filed in the Patent Office, because then there would not have been any
   interference on February 19.^[66][13]

   Although Bell was accused, and is still accused, of stealing the
   telephone from Gray,^[67][14] Bell used Gray's water transmitter design
   only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [68]proof of concept
   scientific experiment^[69][15] to prove to his own satisfaction that
   intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically
   transmitted.^[70][16] Bell's assistant Thomas Watson testified that he
   tested all of the competing designs.^[71][17] After March 1876, Bell
   and Watson focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never
   used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial
   use.^[72][18] When Bell demonstrated his telephone at the Centennial
   Exhibition in June 1876, he used his improved electromagnetic
   transmitter, not Gray's water transmitter.

[[73]edit] Gray's further inventions

   In 1887 Gray invented the "[74]telautograph", a device that could
   remotely transmit handwriting through telegraph systems. Gray was
   granted several patents for these pioneer fax machines, and the Gray
   National Telautograph Company was charted in 1888 and continued in
   business as The Telautograph Corporation for many years; after a series
   of mergers it was finally absorbed by [75]Xerox in the 1990s. Gray's
   telautograph machines were used by banks for signing documents at a
   distance and by the military for sending written commands during gun
   tests when the deafening noise from the guns made spoken orders on the
   telephone impractical. The machines were also used at train stations
   for schedule changes.

   Gray displayed his telautograph invention in 1893 at the [76]1893
   Columbian Exposition and sold his share in the telautograph shortly
   after that. Gray was also chairman of the International Congress of
   Electricians at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.

   Gray conceived of a primitive [77]closed-circuit television system that
   he called the "[78]telephote". Pictures would be focused on an array of
   selenium cells and signals from the selenium cells would be transmitted
   to a distant station on separate wires. At the receiving end each wire
   would open or close a shutter to recreate the image.

   In 1899 Gray moved to Boston where he continued inventing. One of his
   projects was to develop an underwater signaling device to transmit
   messages to ships. One such signaling device was tested on December 31,
   1900. Three weeks later, on January 21, 1901, Gray died from a heart
   attack in [79]Newtonville, Massachusetts.

   As of 2006 no book-length biography has been written about the life of
   Elisha Gray. An [80]Oberlin physics department head named Dr. Lloyd W.
   Taylor began writing a Gray biography, but the book was never finished
   because of Taylor's accidental death in July 1948. Dr Taylor's
   unfinished manuscript is in the College Archives at Oberlin College.

[[81]edit] Gray's publications

   Gray wrote several books including:
