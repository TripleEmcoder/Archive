[[17]edit] Biography

   Ole Andreassen Aaslundeie was born in [18]Vardal (now [19]Gjøvik), in
   [20]Oppland, [21]Norway. The Evinrude surname, which he adopted in the
   United States, came from the Evenrud farm in [22]Vestre Toten, where
   his mother was born. In October 1881 his father emigrated to America,
   followed the next year by his wife and three children. Three additional
   children were born in America. The family settled on a farm in Ripley
   Lake near [23]Cambridge, Wisconsin. At age sixteen Evinrude went to
   [24]Madison, where he worked in machinery stores and studied
   engineering on his own. He became a machinist while working at various
   machine tool firms in [25]Milwaukee, [26]Pittsburgh, and [27]Chicago.

   In 1900, Evinrude co-founded the custom engine firm Clemick & Evinrude.
   In 1907, he invented the first practical and reliable [28]outboard
   motor, which was built of steel and brass, and had a crank on the
   flywheel to start the two-cycle engine. In 1907 he had built his first
   gasoline-powered outboard motor, and two years later, Evinrude Motor
   Company was founded in Milwaukee. The simplest type of engine the
   company produced was a 2-stroke internal combustion engine that was
   powered by a gas mixture of gasoline and oil.

   Evinrude reported that his invention was inspired by rowing a boat on a
   small lake outside [29]Milwaukee, Wisconsin on a hot day to get [30]ice
   cream for his girlfriend, Bess.^[31][3] By 1912, the firm employed 300
   workers. Evinrude let two motorcycle mad teens tinker in his
   [32]Milwaukee based machine shop; one was named Arthur [33]Davidson who
   went on to Harley-Davidson motorcycle fame, also based in
   [34]Milwaukee. Ole Evinrude formed [35]Evinrude Outboard Motors, which
   he sold in 1913 in order to look after his sick wife.

   In 1919, Evinrude invented a more efficient and lighter two-cylinder
   motor. Having sold his part in Clemick & Evinrude, he founded [36]ELTO
   or the Elto Outboard Motor Company. (ELTO was an acronym for "Evinrude
   Light Twin Outboard".) Although Elto faced stiff competition from other
   companies, such as [37]Johnson Motor Company of [38]South Bend,
   Indiana, Evinrude's company survived through acquisitions, eventually
   forming the [39]Outboard Marine Corporation.

   His wife Bess died in 1933, at only 48 years old, and Ole Evinrude died
   the following year, 57 years old. After Evinrude died, his son,
   [40]Ralph Evinrude, took over day-to-day management of the company,
   eventually rising to Chairman of the Board. The company is now called
   [41]Evinrude Outboard Motors, and is owned by [42]Bombardier
   Recreational Products.^[43][4]
