[[25]edit] Early life and education

   He was born in [26]Omaha, [27]Nebraska on May 11, 1904. He attended
   [28]Omaha Central High School, then gained a scholarship to the
   chemical engineering program at Armour Institute of Technology (now
   [29]Illinois Institute of Technology), in [30]Chicago. However, he
   changed to the [31]University of Nebraska, graduating in 1924 in
   Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He completed a Masters at the
   [32]University of Michigan in 1925 and completed a PhD thesis entitled
   "The effect of temperature, purity and temperature drop on the rate of
   condensation of steam" at the same university in 1927.

[[33]edit] Professional life

   From 1927 to 1931 he worked as an engineer at the [34]Eastman Kodak
   Company in [35]Rochester, New York, producing 40 patents. In 1932 he
   joined the [36]Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn as an instructor in
   the newly-independent Department of Chemical Engineering. He was to
   remain there. In 1937 he became Head of Department, which continued
   until 1961, when he was named Distinguished Professor. His duties ended
   in 1976 when he was made Professor Emeritus, but he never officially
   retired and was actively involved with what was by then the Polytechnic
   University until his death on November 1, 1995.

   In 1950, following a divorce, he married his second wife, Mildred Jane
   Topp, also from Omaha, and an English major from the University of
   Nebraska. They were together for 45 years and she died in 1998.

[[37]edit] Accomplishments

   He was a teacher for nearly 60 years, supervising many masters and
   doctoral students. While an academic, he continued to invent, and is
   credited with more than 150 US patents, as well as 350 papers,
   including important ones on the theory and practice of
   [38]distillation.

   In 1945, together with Dr. Raymond Eller Kirk (1890–1957), a
   [39]chemist at the same institute, he began the work which became the
   Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, a major reference
   work. (At that time the only comparable reference work was
   [40]Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, in German.) In 1947
   the first volume was published, and it was completed in 1949. The fifth
   edition was completed in 2007 with 27 volumes.

   For this and other achievements he received awards from the
   [41]American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the [42]American Chemical
   Society, the American Institute of Chemists [43][1] and the [44]Society
   of Chemical Industry. In 1987 he received the New York City Mayor’s
   Award of Honor for Science and Technology. He was named by the readers
   of [45]Chemical and Engineering News as one of the 75 greatest chemical
   scientists ever.

   He was a successful engineering consultant and the money was wisely
   invested so that on the death of his wife, the estate totalled more
   than $750 million, much of which was disbursed in major
   bequests.^[46][2] These included Polytechnic University, [47]Long
   Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, the University of Nebraska and the
   Chemical Heritage Foundation [48][2], resulting in the Othmer Library
   of Chemical History [49][3]. A major bequest was made to [50]Planned
   Parenthood of New York, resulting in the Othmer Institute [51][4].

   He and his wife had supported many other causes in their lifetimes,
   particularly in the fields of local history, medical care and
   institutions related to chemistry and chemical engineering. They are
   commemorated by buildings and awards including the AIChE Sophomore
   Academic Excellence Award.
