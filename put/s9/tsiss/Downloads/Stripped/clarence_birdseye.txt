   Clarence Frank Birdseye II (December 9, 1886 – October 7, 1956) was an
   [15]American [16]inventor who is considered the founder of the modern
   method of freezing food.

[[23]edit] Early work

   In 1910 and 1911, he captured several hundred small mammals and
   isolated several thousand ticks for research into the cause of
   [24]Rocky Mountain spotted fever. His next field assignment, off and on
   from 1912 to 1915, was in [25]Labrador, [26]Canada, where he became
   further interested in food preservation by freezing, especially fast
   freezing. He was taught by the [27]Inuit how to [28]ice fish under very
   thick ice. In -40°C weather, he discovered that the fish he caught
   froze almost instantly, and when thawed, tasted fresh. He recognized
   immediately that the frozen seafood sold in [29]New York was of lower
   quality than the frozen fish of Labrador, and saw that applying this
   knowledge would be lucrative. His journals from this period, which
   record these observations, are held in the Archives and Special
   Collections at [30]Amherst College.

   Conventional freezing methods of the time were commonly done at higher
   temperatures, and thus the freezing occurred much more slowly, giving
   ice crystals more time to grow. It is now known that fast freezing
   produces smaller ice crystals, which cause less damage to the tissue
   structure. When 'slow' frozen foods thaw, cellular fluids leak from the
   ice crystal-damaged tissue, giving the resulting food a mushy or dry
   consistency upon preparation.

   In 1922 Birdseye conducted fish-freezing experiments at the Clothel
   Refrigerating Company, then established his own company, Birdseye
   Seafoods Inc., to freeze fish fillets via chilled air at -45°F (-43°C).
   In 1924 his company went bankrupt due to lack of consumer interest in
   the product. That same year he developed an entirely new process for
   commercially viable [31]quick-freezing: pack fish in cartons, then
   freeze the contents between two refrigerated surfaces under pressure.
   Birdseye created a new company, General Seafood Corporation, to promote
   this method.

[[32]edit] Industrial development

   In 1925 his General Seafood Corporation moved to [33]Gloucester,
   Massachusetts. There it employed Birdseye's newest invention, the
   double belt freezer, in which cold brine chilled a pair of stainless
   steel belts carrying packaged fish, freezing the fish quickly. His
   invention was subsequently issued as US Patent #1,773,079, marking the
   beginning of today's frozen foods industry. Birdseye then took out
   patents on machinery which cooled more quickly so that only small ice
   crystals can form and cell walls are not damaged. In 1927 he began to
   extend the process to quick-freezing of meat, poultry, fruit, and
   vegetables.

   In 1929, Birdseye sold his company and [34]patents for $22 million to
   [35]Goldman Sachs and the [36]Postum Company, which eventually became
   [37]General Foods Corporation, and which founded the [38]Birds Eye
   Frozen Food Company. Birdseye continued to work with the company,
   developing frozen food technology. In 1930 the company began sales
   experiments in 18 retail stores around [39]Springfield, Massachusetts,
   to test consumer acceptance of quick-frozen foods. The initial product
   line featured 26 items, including 18 cuts of frozen meat, spinach and
   peas, a variety of fruits and berries, blue point oysters, and fish
   fillets. Consumer acceptance was strong, and today this experiment is
   considered the birth of retail frozen foods. The "Birds Eye" name
   remains a leading frozen-food brand.

[[40]edit] Death

   He died on October 7, 1956, of a heart attack at the [41]Gramercy Park
   Hotel. He was 69 years old.^[42][1]
