   John Adams Howell (16 March 1840–1918) was a [14]Rear Admiral of the
   [15]United States Navy, who served during the [16]Civil War and the
   [17]Spanish–American War. He was also a noted inventor.

[[18]edit] Biography

   Howell was born in [19]Bath, New York, on 16 March 1840. He graduated
   from the [20]United States Naval Academy in 1858, and was promoted to
   lieutenant in April 1861.^[21][1]

   During the [22]American Civil War, Howell served as executive officer
   of the steam sloop [23]Ossipee at the [24]Battle of Mobile Bay on 5
   August 1864, and was honorably mentioned by his commanding officer in
   his despatches.^[25][1]

   Howell was promoted to lieutenant-commander in March 1865, and
   commander on 6 March 1872.^[26][1]

   Howell was an Assistant in the [27]U.S. Coast Survey, and the
   commanding officer of the Coast Survey steamer [28]A. D. Bache in the
   early 1870s. The "Howell Basin", in the Atlantic Ocean, east of
   [29]Cape Cod, and the "Howell Hook", a submerged reef off the coast of
   southern Florida, are named in his honor.^[30][1]

   Howell was promoted to captain on 1 March 1884, and in 1887 was a
   member of the Naval Advisory Board. He was promoted to rear admiral in
   1898.^[31][1] During the [32]Spanish–American War he commanded a
   division of the [33]North Atlantic Squadron.^[34][2]

   Rear Admiral Howell died in 1918.

[[35]edit] Inventions

   Howell is remembered less for his wartime achievements than for his
   innovations in ordnance. He invented the self-steering torpedo—the
   "[36]Howell torpedo"—and also patented torpedo launchers, gyroscopes
   for the guidance of torpedoes, explosive shells, a disappearing gun
   carriage for shore defense emplacement, and an amphibious
   lifeboat.^[37][3]
