   Roy E. Weatherby was the founder and owner of [12]Weatherby, Inc., an
   [13]American rifle, shotgun and cartridge manufacturing company set up
   in 1945. Weatherby created an entire line of custom cartridges, and was
   one of the people responsible for the industry interest in high-speed
   cartridges. He created a custom rifle action to accommodate his
   high-pressure cartridges.

[[14]edit] History

   He grew up on a farm in Kansas. He later moved to [15]Huntington Park,
   [16]California where he and his wife, Camela, bought a Spanish style
   home located on 7672 California Street on the corner of Grand Avenue.
   Weatherby started manufacturing Weatherby Guns in his garage at the
   Huntington Park home. As orders for his guns increased, and social
   appointment pressed him and his wife to be away from home, his
   daughter, Diane, was often cared for by the neighbor lady, Emma Jones.

   Weatherby firearms are best known for their very high-powered rifle
   cartridges, all bearing the name [17]Weatherby Magnum such as the
   [18].257 Weatherby Magnum and the [19].460 Weatherby Magnum, and for
   the production of appropriately-chambered sporting rifles.

   Weatherby came into the world of commercial cartridge and rifle making
   with a background of experimentation in cartridge [20]wildcatting and
   was determined to develop a range of sporting rifle cartridges that
   would produce very high [21]muzzle velocities, high bullet energies,
   very flat [22]trajectories, and very hard-hitting characteristics at
   long range. Among those who influenced his thinking and products was
   the English riflemaker and cartridge designer [23]David Lloyd.

   Following the considerable commercial success of Weatherby Inc., Roy
   Weatherby established the Weatherby Foundation (initially known as the
   Roy E. Weatherby Foundation) as a non-profit, tax-exempt Foundation to
   educate the non-hunting public about the beneficial role of ethical
   sporting hunting, especially its contributions to wildlife
   conservation. It currently leads a national initiative to foster the
   development of educational outdoor expositions, and as at 2007 has
   sponsored 78 events in 19 of the US states, with combined attendance
   figures of nearly 1 million. The Foundation annually sponsors the
   prestigious Weatherby Hunting & Conservation Award.
