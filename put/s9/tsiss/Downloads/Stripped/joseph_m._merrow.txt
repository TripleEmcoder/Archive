   Joseph Millard Merrow (June 24, 1848 – March 27, 1947) was president of
   the [16]Merrow Machine Company.

   Merrow was born in the community of Merrow, town of [17]Mansfield in
   [18]Connecticut. His parents were [19]J. B. Merrow and Harriet Millard
   Merrow. He was educated at the Munson Mass Academy and [20]Hartford
   Public High School.

   At the age of 15 he was employed as a [21]pharmacist and a
   [22]postmaster, appointed by [23]Abraham Lincoln.

   Established in 1838, the family business was the manufacture of knit
   cotton goods; it was the first of its kind in the country. In 1888 the
   family's mills were destroyed by fire related to an incident with
   gunpowder. J. B. Merrow held a patent on gunpowder. The destruction of
   the mill allowed the company to further develop a small shop that had
   previously supported the knitting mill, and the Merrow Mills thus
   became primarily a manufacturer of crochet sewing machines.

   Joseph Merrow was the driving force behind Merrow developing new
   technology, growing the new business and transforming it from a
   regional supplier of crochet sewing machines, to the market leader
   manufacturing hundreds of models of industrial overlock sewing
   machines. Under his leadership the company achieved a place of
   prominence in the industrial machine field with sales world-wide,
   hundreds of patents and the industries first industrial overlock sewing
   machine.

   Merrow was also active in politics. In 1880 he was elected to the House
   of Representatives of the General Assembly. He was founder and
   president of the Hartford County Manufacturers association. In addition
   he founded the Industrial Memorials Inc, a business group that devoted
   its time to commemorating pioneer manufacturers by funding and locating
   plaques and statues. He was president from 1939 until 1946.

   Merrow traveled the world, taking several dozen trips to [24]europe and
   [25]asia, while studying the industrial conditions of the countries he
   visited.

   He was a writer and a poet. The [26]Hartford Courant writing his
   obituary quotes him as having defined war as the 'history of the human
   race in a single word, Greed the cause of war and brotherly love the
   cure for greed and the end of war'.^[[27]cite this quote]

   Merrow never married, although his great nephews Owen and [28]Charlie
   Merrow maintain his legacy as the current managers of the [29]Merrow
   Sewing Machine Company.
