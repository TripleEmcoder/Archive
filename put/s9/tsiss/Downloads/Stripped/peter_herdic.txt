                              Peter Herdic
      Born    December 14, 1824
              [7]Fort Plain, New York
      Died    February 2, 1888
              [8]Huntingdon, Pennsylvania
   Occupation philanthropist, lumber baron, entrepreneur, inventor, and
              politician
     Spouse   Amanda, Encie Maynard
    Children  Peter Jr. and Henry with Encie
    Parents   Henry and Elizabeth

   Peter Herdic (1824–1888) was a [9]lumber baron, [10]entrepreneur,
   [11]inventor, [12]politician, and [13]philanthropist in [14]Victorian
   era [15]Williamsport, [16]Lycoming County, [17]Pennsylvania in the
   [18]United States. He was the youngest of seven children born to Henry
   and Elizabeth Herdic on December 14, 1824 in [19]Fort Plain, [20]New
   York.^[21][1] Herdic's father died in 1826 and Elizabeth Herdic
   remarried shortly thereafter. She was widowed again prior to 1837 when
   she moved her family to [22]Pipe Creek, New York near [23]Ithaca.
   Herdic attended school for just a few years while he worked on his
   mother's 50-acre (200,000 m^2) farm.^[24][2] Herdic left his mother's
   farm in 1846 and arrived in Lycoming County later that same year, where
   he settled in [25]Cogan House Township.

   Herdic would go on to become one of the wealthiest men in Pennsylvania
   and was a major figure in the development of the lumber industry
   throughout North Central Pennsylvania. Herdic donated large amounts of
   land and money to various churches in Williamsport.^[26][3] Peter
   Herdic was the inventor of the [27]Herdic cab (a precursor to the
   [28]taxi), which was a two wheeled horse drawn [29]carriage with side
   seats and a rear entrance.^[30][4] Peter Herdic died on February 2,
   1888 as the result of a [31]concussion sustained when he slipped and
   fell on ice while inspecting his [32]waterworks in [33]Huntingdon,
   Pennsylvania.^[34][1]

[[39]edit] Early career

   Pennsylvania State Historical Marker for Peter Herdic in front of his
   Williamsport home

   In the early 1840s, Herdic worked at a [40]sawmill near his home in
   [41]Upstate New York. In two years work there, he saved a considerable
   amount of money. After leaving his mother's farm in 1846, Peter Herdic
   settled along [42]Lycoming Creek in Cogan House Township, Pennsylvania,
   just north of Williamsport. Here Herdic, with his business partner
   William Andress, opened a [43]sawmill, using his saving for the
   purchase and initial operation of the sawmill.^[44][2] This was the
   first of Herdic's many business ventures, that led to his rise as one
   of the richest of [45]millionaires in Williamsport.

   Peter Herdic moved to Williamsport in 1853, which was then a small
   village of 1,700 people surrounded by vast stands of [46]virgin
   [47]hemlock, [48]white pine and various hardwoods.^[49][3] The lumber
   industry had existed in Lycoming County since the first Europeans
   arrived prior to the [50]American Revolution, but it did not become the
   land-changing and [51]eco-system altering industry until Peter Herdic
   and men like him arrived on the scene in the mid-19th century. The
   lumber era began in force in 1846 when the [52]Susquehanna Boom, a
   series of cribs for holding and storing floating logs on the [53]West
   Branch Susquehanna River was built under the leadership of James
   Perkins.^[54][5] Herdic was able to use his business sense, leadership
   abilities, and according to some questionable business tactics^[55][6]
   to rapidly acquire wealth by buying and selling several tracts of
   [56]timber and several sawmills. He used his gains to purchase several
   tracts of land in Williamsport, more sawmills, and eventually the
   [57]Susquehanna Boom.

   Peter Herdic and two business partners, Mahlon Fisher and John Reading,
   purchased the Susquehanna Boom and expanded it so that it could hold up
   to 300 million board feet (700 million m³) of lumber. At this time the
   most efficient sawmill in Williamsport could process only 100,000 board
   feet (200 m³) of lumber in a week.^[58][3] The sawmills at first could
   not possibly keep up with the vast amounts of lumber floating in the
   West Branch. The approximately 60 sawmills along the river between
   Lycoming and [59]Loyalsock Creeks operated day and night on a year
   round basis. Peter Herdic, his partners and many other businessmen in
   Williamsport, became fabulously wealthy. They made Williamsport, "The
   Lumber Capital of the World" with the highest number of millionaires
   [60]per capita of any city in the [61]United States.^[62][3]

[[63]edit] Leadership

   The former Herdic Hotel in Williamsport

   Peter Herdic used his wealth to gain political power in Williamsport
   and Lycoming County, and led the drive to have Williamsport chartered
   as a [64]city in 1866. He spent $20,000 to get elected [65]mayor of
   Williamsport in 1869. Local [66]saloon keepers reported that Herdic
   would leave $10 and $20 bills among the bottles of their [67]taverns
   for anybody that would vote for him in the [68]election.^[69][2] Prior
   to Herdic's arrival, the Newberry section of Williamsport was known as
   Jaysburg and had vied with Williamsport to be the [70]county seat of
   Lycoming County. Herdic saw to it that the rival community on the west
   bank of Lycoming Creek would no longer compete with Williamsport by
   leading the cause to [71]annex the community to Williamsport. Herdic
   had such influence that he was able to have the [72]Philadelphia and
   Erie Railroad move their passenger station from the Pine Street area to
   his Herdic Hotel on West Fourth Street.^[73][1]^[74][2] Herdic was able
   to profit from this since the trains would now deposit their passengers
   at the door of his opulent [75]hotel.

   The Williamsport Passenger Railway Company was founded by Peter Herdic.
   This precursor to the [76]trolley system, later followed by the bus
   system, was a form of [77]public transit. It was one of Herdic's few
   business ventures that was not profitable. He divested himself of the
   Williamsport Passenger Railway Company in 1879, a time in Herdic's life
   when he lost most of his wealth (only to reacquire most of it soon
   after). Peter Herdic used his position as an owner of the Susquehanna
   Boom to maintain high levies on the lumbermen who floated their logs
   down the West Branch Susquehanna River. These lumbermen teamed together
   to seek relief from the high levies from the [78]Pennsylvania General
   Assembly. Peter Herdic used his wealth and political connections to buy
   the votes of many of the members of the assembly.^[79][2] He had to
   borrow heavily against his holding to provide the legislators with the
   money needed for their votes. This heavy borrowing combined with the
   Financial [80]Panic of 1873 lead to Peter Herdic's eventual
   [81]bankruptcy in 1878.

   Peter Herdic was knocked down, but he was not knocked out. He would
   regain his wealth soon after by leading the building of various
   waterworks in several U.S. cities including [82]Selinsgrove and
   [83]Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, [84]Orlando, Florida and [85]Cairo,
   Illinois.^[86][1]^[87][2] He also continued to be a leading citizen of
   Williamsport.

[[88]edit] Legacy

   The Weightman Block was built by Herdic

   Peter Herdic left his mark on Williamsport through churches, homes,
   hotels and other real estate developments. The Peter Herdic house, his
   personal mansion at 407 West Fourth Street stands today as a fine
   dining restaurant.^[89][7] The house and a neighboring mansion were
   renovated in 1984 to a condition similar to when Peter Herdic lived
   there.^[90][8] It is an example of Italian Villa architecture with
   ornate plaster moldings and arches, a curving mahogany stairway and
   acanthus columns. The Peter Herdic Hotel, also on West Fourth Street,
   is now known as 800 Park Place. It is the home of two business and
   several apartments. It was previously served as a [91]nursing home and
   hotel.^[92][9] The Weightman Block takes up on entire city block on
   West Fourth Street. Herdic had this block constructed in 1870. He had
   planned to use it as a center of business in downtown Williamsport. It
   included a [93]opera house and fifth floor penthouse. Herdic was forced
   to sell it to William Weightman in 1878 after he declared
   bankruptcy.^[94][8] The Weightman Block was also renovated in the late
   1990s it currently houses several small businesses on the ground floors
   with numerous apartments above.

   Peter Herdic donated the land and or building materials for several of
   Williamsport's oldest and historic churches. [95]Trinity Episcopal
   Church was funded entirely by Peter Herdic. He donated the land and
   paid for its construction. The structure was built in 1871 from
   mountain stone that was quarried from [96]Bald Eagle Mountain near
   [97]South Williamsport.^[98][6] Herdic also donated the land or
   provided funds for Annunciation Roman Catholic Church, First Baptist
   Church, First Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Congregational Church
   and Temple Beth Ha Sholom.^[99][2]^[100][8]
   Detail of the patent application for the Herdic carriage

   Peter Herdic's name will live on forever in the
   [101]dictionary.^[102][10] His invention the [103]herdic was a small
   two wheeled carriage that was towed by a horse. The cab had side seats
   and rear entrance. Many transportation historians regard the herdic as
   a predecessor of the [104]taxicab. The first herdic cabs carried up to
   eight passengers.^[105][4] The earliest herdics were painted bright
   yellow and quickly acquired the canary nickname. Each cab was small
   enough to move freely through the city streets of Williamsport and
   leave its passengers at the curb instead of the middle of the street
   was other modes of public transportation were forced to do. Peter
   Herdic had moderated success with his cab and was able to sell it to
   the cities of [106]Philadelphia and [107]Washington, D.C. The herdic
   cab was in service in Washington as late as 1918.^[108][4]

   Herdic's death in February 1888 was noted in the Sunday [109]Grit as
   the passing of a leader and philanthropist. "Peter Herdic as really the
   father of Williamsport. He was a progressive citizen; whatever may be
   said by his enemies, it cannot be denied that had it not been for Peter
   Herdic, Williamsport might be nothing more than a village of a few
   thousand inhabitants." An editorial in the [110]Williamsport Sun
   Gazette on March 4, 1988 marking the 100th anniversary of his death
   stated, "Historians have been unable to settle on Herdic as a hero or a
   scoundrel for his financial dealings so he remains somewhere in-between
   a century later. The mark he made on the city of Williamsport is
   indelible."^[111][2]
