   Nathan Ames (November 17, 1826 in [9]Roxbury, New Hampshire – August
   17, 1865 in [10]Saugus, Massachusetts)^[11][1] Educated at [12]Phillips
   Academy, Andover, and Harvard, Ames was a [13]patent [14]solicitor who
   held the first patent in the United States for an [15]escalator-like
   machine. The patent (#25,076) was granted on August 9, 1859 for an
   invention he called "Revolving Stairs". ^[16][2]^[17][3] The escalator
   had steps mounted on a continuous belt or chain. He also patented
   machines for improvement in polishing [18]leather during the time when
   [19]Lynn's [20]shoemaking industry was one of the largest in the world.
   Another one of his patents was for a [21]polygraph, an early copying
   machine that operated by using pens connected by wires.^[22][4] Another
   patent he held was for an improved grater.^[23][5]

   A writer and a poet, Ames has a disquisition and a Class Ode published
   during his time at [24]Harvard. His book of poetry Pirate’s Glen and
   Dungeon Rock was published in 1853. These poems were based the local
   [25]pirate legend of Dungeon Rock.^[26][6]

   His brother [27]Joseph was an American [28]portrait [29]artist.
