   William Mark Goddard (July 10, 1913 in [14]St. Joseph, Missouri –
   September 29, 1997 in [15]Chico, California) was an engineer for
   [16]IBM and an American inventor. He earned a degree in [17]physics
   from [18]Occidental College. Before working in industry, Goddard was a
   high school science teacher in Los Angeles. He briefly worked in the
   [19]aerospace industry^[20][1] for [21]North American Aviation, Inc.
   before becoming an engineer at [22]International Business Machines
   (IBM). His most acclaimed achievement is co-inventing along with
   [23]John Lynott United States Patent 3,503,060, which is entitled
   “Direct Access Magnetic Disc Storage Device”. This invention is the
   claims modern-day [24]hard disk drives.

[[36]edit] Pre-IBM

   Goddard worked on wind tunnel work for [37]North American Aviation. He
   was to work on similar wind tunnel innovations for a Los Angeles
   airplane manufacturer at [38]IBM, but shortly after he was hired, the
   contract for that project was dropped. Goddard was instead hired as an
   engineer, and became involved in the magnetic storage disk project when
   the [39]United States Air Force called upon [40]IBM in order to be
   “mechanized”. The base required a mechanism to “store data” virtually
   for its operations, and from this necessity, the disk storage project
   was conceived.

[[41]edit] RAMAC Project at IBM

   William Goddard and John Lynott were key members of the San Jose,
   California–based engineering team, led by Reynold Johnson with the help
   of Louis Stevens, that developed the 350 Disk Storage Unit, a major
   component of the 305 RAMAC Computer.^[42][1] The magnetic disk drive
   symbolized a monumental advance in mass-storage technology. It is
   responsible for the end of sequential storage and batch processing with
   [43]punched cards and [44]paper tape.

   The CPU unit, also known as the [45]305 Processing unit, was
   responsible for the write-in and read-out operations of the [46]IBM
   350. “Instructions” were provided to the unit coded as “memory
   addresses”. These addresses referred to specific locations on the disc
   in which a transducer was either commanded to write-in or read-out
   data.

   Goddard’s research began in the early 1950s at IBM’s Laboratory located
   on 99 Notre Dame Avenue in [47]San Jose, [48]CA.

   He did not see his work as particularly complex. As he puts it, “it was
   not high tech, or very scientific. It was more like something you’d do
   in your garage.”

   The [49]350 Disk Storage Unit consisted of the magnetic disk memory
   unit with an access mechanism, the controls for the access mechanism,
   and a small air compressor. Assembled with covers, the 350 apparatus
   was 60 inches (1.52 m) long, 68 inches (1.73 m) high and 29 inches
   (0.74 m) deep. It was configured with 50 magnetic disks containing
   50,000 sectors, each of which held 100 six-bit alphanumeric characters,
   for a capacity of 5 million six-bit characters.

   Disks rotated at 1,200 rpm, tracks were recorded at up to 100 bits per
   inch, and typical head-to-disk spacing was 800 microinches (20 µm). The
   execution of a "seek" instruction positioned a read-write head to the
   track that contained the desired sector and selected the sector for a
   later read or write operation. Seek time averaged about 600
   milliseconds.

[[50]edit] Specifications of the original IBM 350

   • Capacity: 5 million characters • Disks: 50 • Access time: 800 ms •
   Tracks per side: 100 • Area density: 2000 bit/in^2 • Rotational speed:
   1200 rpm

[[51]edit] Air-bearing head

   The magnetic disk drive consisted of a stack of closely spaced,
   magnetically coated disks mounted on a rotating shaft, with read-write
   heads that did not physically touch the storage surface. Goddard’s and
   Lynott's key innovation was the air-bearing head, which “floated” very
   close to the rotating disks without actually touching them, greatly
   increasing the speed of access.

   This air-bearing head, also known as a magnetic transducer, had the
   ability to move freely, which enabled the disk to be recorded and read
   from a vast number of different positions.

   The primary purpose of the air-bearing head was to allow the device to
   have rapid random access ability to any storage location. Additionally,
   the creation also allowed several magnetic discs to be mounted on a
   shaft in which a transducer could interact with more than one magnetic
   disk.

[[52]edit] Patents

   An [53]invention disclosure, filed on December 14, 1954 by Lou Stevens,
   Ray Bowdle, Jim Davis, Dave Kean, Bill Goddard and John Lynott resulted
   in two US Patents, 3,134,997, "Data Storage Machine" to Stevens,
   Goddard and Lynott, claiming the RAMAC and subsequently 3,503,060,
   "Direct Access Magnetic Storage Disk Device" to Goddard and Lynott,
   claiming floating heads and disk drives in general. These patents make
   an analogy to how his invention acts hypothetically: “the operation may
   be compared with the manner in which skilled operators select cards
   from a card file index.”

[[54]edit] Evolution of the IBM 350

   [55]Hard disk drives to this date follow the [56]350 Disk Storage Unit.
   They are used as the main components for storage on today’s
   [57]personal computers. Similar to [58]floppy disks, the data on hard
   drives are read and written via a spindle. [59]Hard disk drives have
   many times more storage space than the [60]IBM 350 due to considerable
   innovations in storage space densities on disks. [61]Kryder's Law,
   similar to [62]Moore's Law, indicates that storage space doubles on an
   annual basis.

[[63]edit] Magnetic Disk Heritage Center

   The [64]Magnetic Disk Heritage Center has played an active role in
   preserving RAMAC 350 units created by Johnson and his team at [65]IBM.
   Originally located at [66]Santa Clara University, the project was
   managed by Dr. [67]Al Hoagland and a group of seniors at the
   university. Operations have since moved to the [68]Computer History
   Museum in [69]Mountain View, [70]CA. Goddard’s daughter, Bonnie Burham,
   is one of the organization’s major private donors.^[[71]citation

[[72]edit] National Inventors Hall of Fame

   William Goddard was inducted in the [73]National Inventors Hall of Fame
   with [74]John Lynott in 2007 for their contribution to the invention of
   the first magnetic disk drive. It is hailed as one of the most
   significant inventions in the computer industry and it has since
   emerged to become an industry of its own with an annual revenue of $22
   billion worldwide.
