[[27]edit] Early years

   The Lowell canal system as it appeared when Francis joined the Locks
   and Canals Company

   James Francis was born in [28]South Leigh, near [29]Witney,
   [30]Oxfordshire in [31]England, [32]United Kingdom. He started his
   engineering career at the early age of 14 as he worked as his father's
   apprentice at the Port Craw Railway and Harbor Works in [33]South
   Wales.^[34][1] When he turned 18, he decided to emigrate to the
   [35]United States, in 1833. His first job was in [36]Stonington,
   Connecticut as an assistant to the railway engineer [37]George
   Washington Whistler Jr., working on the [38]New York and New Haven
   Railroad. A year later, James and his boss, Whistler, travelled north
   to [39]Lowell, MA,^[40][2] where at the age of 19, he got a
   [41]draftsman job with the [42]Locks and Canal Company, and Whistler
   became chief engineer.

   A few short years later, in 1837, G.W. Whistler resigned and he and his
   son, the famous painter [43]James Whistler, went to work on
   [44]Russia's major railroads, and appointed Francis to Chief Engineer,
   and sold him his house on Worthen street. That same year, James married
   Sarah W. Brownell in Lowell on July 12, 1837.^[45][3] Their first son,
   James Jr. was born March 30, 1840, and then they had five more
   children.

   In 1841 came his first major project for the company. Francis was to
   analysis how much water each mill factory was using from the companies
   channel system. Impressed by his abilities, the company named him
   "Manager of Locks and Canals" in 1845.^[46][1]

   As Manager & Chief Engineer, Francis was responsible for the
   construction of the [47]Northern Canal and Moody Street Feeder. These
   two canals, built in the late 1840s and early 1850s, completed the 5.6
   mile long Lowell canal system, and greatly increased its industrial
   power of the thriving industrial cities' mill complexes.

   During his work on the Lowell systems, James was also consulted on many
   other water projects nation wide. When New York needed to increase
   their water supply, he consulted on the construction of the [48]Quaker
   Bridge Dam on the [49]Croton River in [50]New York. He also consulted
   on the dam at [51]Saint Anthony Falls on the [52]Mississippi
   river.^[53][1]

   Their son James fought in the [54]American Civil War as a [55]2nd
   Lieutenant in 1861. He was wounded in the hand at the [56]Battle of
   Antietam as a [57]Captain, and finished the war in July 1865 as
   [58]Lieutenant Colonel.^[59][4]

[[60]edit] Fire sprinkler system

   In 1845, James Francis developed the first sprinkler systems ever
   devised in the United States^[[61]citation needed]. On top of Lynde
   Hill, in the Belvidere section of Lowell, he had a 2,000,000-gallon
   [62]reservoir constructed with a 36-inch-diameter (910 mm) underground
   cast-iron branch mains connecting to several mills. The first simple
   gravity system was first implemented at the Suffolk Mill Picker Houses.
   About twenty years later, in 1869, Francis contracted [63]Frederick
   Ginnell of the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Company to install a
   "perforated pipe" system invented in [64]England by John Carney in
   1906, to work with Francis' system. The two became friends, and shared
   and tested many ideas. Their systems also became very popular with the
   mill owners and insurance companies, and the Providence Steam and Gas
   Pipe Company began installing similar systems throughout the mills in
   [65]Fall River, Massachusetts and elsewhere.^[66][5]

   The Francis system was simple: Valves would be opened manually,
   allowing water to flow through an array of pipes tucked close to
   ceilings, and ending with small jets spraying the water. The big issue
   was that this sprinkler system was throughout the entire building, so
   any use of the system would flood the entire structure and all its
   contents. It was not until 1875, that [67]Henry Parmelee invented a
   sprinkler head that only activated one at a time, and that is when
   sprinkler systems became very popular.^[68][5]

[[69]edit] Turbines

   James also became fascinated with, and tinkered with turbine designs,
   after [70]Uriah A. Boyden first demonstrated his Boyden turbine in
   Lowell. The two engineers worked on improving the turbine. And in 1848,
   Francis and Boyden successfully improved the turbine with, what is now
   known as the [71]Francis turbine. Francis' turbine eclipsed the Boyden
   turbine, in power by 90%. In 1855, Francis published this important
   findings in the "Lowell Hydraulic Experiments".^[72][6]

[[73]edit] Flood control

   The Great Gate, also known as Francis' Folly.

   In 1850, he also ordered the construction of the Great Gate over the
   Pawtucket Canal to protect the downtown mills from any devastating
   floods. This project quickly became known as; "Francis' Folly", for no
   one believed it would work, never mind that it may ever be needed. But,
   less than two years later, in 1852, the gates saved the city of Lowell
   from the devastating floods of 1852, then again in; [74]1936, [75]1938,
   [76]2006, and 2007 by preventing the Merrimack River from entering the
   canal system. However, arson damage to the wooden gate in the 1970s,
   and the difficult method of dropping it (by breaking a large chain
   link) prompted the city to use a more modern steel-beam bulkhead in its
   place in 2006. For his efforts in saving the city from great disaster
   Mr. Francis was awarded a massive silver pitcher and a [77]salver by
   the City of Lowell.^[78][7]

   In 1886, James B. Francis, teamed up with two other Civil Engineers;
   Eliot C. Clarke and Clemens Herschel to study and publish their
   findings in the "Prevention of Floods in the Valley of Stony Brook"
   which laid out a flood prevention system for the city of [79]Boston.
   The intense study reviewed the [80]Forest Hills, [81]Hyde Park,
   [82]Franklin park and [83]Roslindale sections of the city that were
   subject to flooding.^[84][8]

   In 1889, Francis was also called to duty as a member of the commission
   to examine the cause of the [85]Johnstown, PA disaster, when the
   [86]South Fork Dam broke, killing over 2,200 people.^[87][7]

[[88]edit] Later years

   Francis stayed active on all levels of involvement in the city of
   Lowell, and even served as a Cities' [89]Aldermen from
   1862-1864^[90][9]

   In 1865, James researched and publish his findings on cast iron, and
   their use as structural columns in; "The Strength of Cast-Iron
   Columns."

   Francis also originated [91]scientific methods of testing [92]hydraulic
   machinery, and was a founding member of the [93]American Society of
   Civil Engineers and its president in 1880.

   In 1883, James completed his calculation standards for water flow
   rates, now known as the Francis equation or Francis Formula, usually
   used in [94]Fluid Dynamics in conjunction with calculating
   [95]weirs.^[96][10] Q=3.33h1 3/2 (L-0.2h1)

   Q= discharge in ft3/s neglecting velocity of approach

   L =the length of weir in feet

   h1= head on the weir in feet

   He remained at the [97]Locks and Canal Company for his entire career,
   until retirement in 1884 at the age of 69, and remained on as a
   consultant right up until his death. His son James took over as Chief
   Engineer. The rest of his life he spent with his wife Sarah, and their
   six children in their home on Worthen Street, which was Whistlers old
   home and now the [98]Whistler House Museum of Art. Francis died at the
   on September 18, 1892, age of 77, and is buried at [99]Lowell Cemetery
   under a massive pillar of cut granite stones, symbolizing the stones
   used to make the canals.^[100][11]

[[101]edit] Honors

   For all his contributions to the world of engineering and personal
   generosity, the following are named in his honor:
     * James B. Francis College of Engineering at the [102]University of
       Lowell; Masters, Ph.D and D.Eng. Engineering degrees and research
       in over seven Engineering programs, including Plastics and Nuclear

       head.

[[108]edit] Notable Uses of the Francis Turbine

   A [109]Francis turbine runner, rated at nearly one million [110]hp (750
   MW), being installed at the [111]Grand Coulee Dam, United States.

   Today, the Francis Turbine is the most widely used [112]Water turbine
   in the world, including [113]China's new [114]Three Gorges Dam as the
   world's largest hydroelectric power station in the world, with a total
   capacity of 22,500 MW. With the incorporation of the Francis turbine
   into almost every [115]Hydroelectric dam built since 1900, it is
   responsible for generating almost 1/5 of all the worlds electricity:
