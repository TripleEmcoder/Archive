    Known for  [11]electric railway

   Charles Joseph Van Depoele (Lichtervelde, 27 April [12]1846 - 18 March
   1892) was an [13]electrical engineer, inventor, and pioneer in
   [14]electric railway technology. Van Depoele was born in
   [15]Lichtervelde, [16]Belgium. At a tender age he dabbled in
   electricity, and became so thoroughly infatuated with the subject that
   he entered upon a course of study and experiment at [17]Poperinghe. In
   1861, while at college, he produced his first light with a battery of
   forty [18]Bunsen cells. Later, he moved to [19]Lille, [20]France, where
   he attended regularly the lectures and experiments of the Imperial
   Lyceum, from 1864 to 1869.

[[29]edit] Move to the USA

   In 1869 he moved to the [30]United States and took up his residence in
   [31]Detroit, where he made a living by manufacturing furniture. He did
   not abandon his electrical pursuits, experimenting with [32]electric
   lighting, [33]electric generators and [34]electric motors, and
   eventually forming the Van Depoele Electric Manufacturing Company.

[[35]edit] Electric railways

   As early as 1874, Van Depoele began investigations into the field of
   electric locomotion. Van Depoele's first [36]electric railway was laid
   in [37]Chicago early in 1883, and he exhibited another at an exposition
   in that city later in the same year. Near the end of 1887, thirteen
   North American cities had electric railways in operation; nine of these
   systems were designed by Van Depoele, and used [38]overhead lines to
   transmit electric current from an [39]electrical generator to the
   [40]electric locomotives on the rails.

[[41]edit] Electric lighting

   Van Depoele sold his electric motor business and related patents to the
   [42]Thomson-Houston Electric Company in early 1888. He briefly
   thereafter devoted his efforts to his electric lighting business, until
   he sold that concern also to Thomson-Houston in mid-1889.

[[43]edit] Patents

   A prolific inventor, Van Depoele was granted at least 243 United States
   [44]patents between 1881 and 1894 for various electric inventions
   including railway systems, lights, generators, motors, current
   regulators, pumps, telpher systems, batteries, hammers, rock drills,
   brakes, a gearless locomotive, a coal-mining machine, and a
   pile-driver.

[[45]edit] Recognition

   He received the most recognition for his role in the development of
   electric railways; George Herbert Stockbridge wrote in 1891, "It is
   probably only just to Mr. Van Depoele to say that he is entitled to
   more credit than any other one man for the exploitation of electricity
   as a motive power."

[[46]edit] Death

   Van Depoele died at 46 years of age in [47]Lynn, Massachusetts, leaving
   a wife and several children.
