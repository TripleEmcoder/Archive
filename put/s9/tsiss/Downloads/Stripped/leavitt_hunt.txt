   [22]Col. Leavitt Hunt ^[23][1](1831–February 16, 1907) was a
   Harvard-educated attorney and photography pioneer who was one of the
   first people to photograph the [24]Middle East. He and a companion,
   Nathan Flint Baker, traveled to [25]Egypt, the [26]Holy Land,
   [27]Lebanon, [28]Turkey and [29]Greece on a [30]Grand Tour in 1851–52,
   making one of the earliest photographic records of the Arab and ancient
   worlds, including the [31]Great Sphinx and the [32]Great Pyramid, views
   along the [33]Nile River, the ruins at [34]Petra and the [35]Parthenon
   in Greece.

[[42]edit] Biography

   The youngest son of [43]General [44]Jonathan Hunt of Vermont and the
   former [45]Jane Maria Leavitt, and brother to architect [46]Richard
   Morris Hunt and painter [47]William Morris Hunt,^[48][n 1] Leavitt Hunt
   was born in [49]Brattleboro, Vermont, but grew up in [50]Paris
   following the early death of his father [51]Jonathan Hunt, a Vermont
   Congressman whose father had been the state's [52]Lieutenant Governor.

   Leavitt Hunt attended the [53]Boston Latin School,^[54][2] and
   subsequently enrolled in a Swiss boarding school, finally taking a law
   degree from the [55]University of Heidelberg. He then enrolled at the
   Swiss Military Academy in [56]Thun. Hunt was a scholar: he was fluent
   in French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and could write in
   both [57]Persian and [58]Sanskrit.^[59][n 2]

   Hunt's companion on his [60]Middle Eastern journey was a wealthy
   sculptor from Ohio and friend of the Hunt family. Nathan Flint Baker
   had been travelling in Europe for a decade, and announced his intention
   to travel through the Middle East. Hunt decided to join him, meeting
   him in [61]Florence, Italy, in late September 1851.

   Hunt and Baker spent several weeks in [62]Rome practicing photography,
   and then sailed from [63]Naples to [64]Malta and eventually up the
   [65]Nile River into the [66]Sinai Peninsula, to [67]Petra (where they
   were among the first to photograph the ruins), then on to
   [68]Jerusalem, to what is today [69]Lebanon, then on to
   [70]Constantinople and [71]Athens, before returning to Paris in May
   1852.

   Hunt's and Baker's photographs were dazzling, especially for a
   brand-new medium many had never seen before. They photographed the
   [72]Great Sphinx and the Pyramids at [73]Giza, the templex complex at
   [74]Karnak, the [75]Ramesseum at [76]Thebes, and the ruins on the
   Island of [77]Philae. They travelled farther to photograph the
   [78]Monastery of St. Catherine at [79]Mount Sinai, the tombs and
   temples of Petra, the [80]Church of the Holy Sepulchre in
   [81]Jerusalem, the ruins at [82]Baalbek, and finally the buildings of
   the [83]Acropolis in Athens.

   The 60 extant photographs from their journey show that Hunt and Baker
   were keen on the new medium and familiar with its techniques. It was a
   real partnership: both men brought their own strengths to the process,
   and images that survive demonstrate their aesthetic acumen as well as
   their journalistic desire to show the settings in which they worked.
   One image of an unveiled [84]Ghawazee female dancer, signed on the
   negative by Hunt himself, is likely the earliest photographic portrait
   of a Middle Eastern woman. Another image of the less photogenic view
   from the rear of the [85]Parthenon demonstrates two men unafraid to
   indulge their take on a revered landmark.

   Leavitt Hunt, circa 1852, [86]The Library of Congress

   The trip was a logistical challenge. Accompanying the two travelers for
   part of the journey were Leavitt Hunt's older brother, the architect
   Richard Morris Hunt, and two other friends. The group hired a
   dahaheah^[87][n 3] and a crew of 13 Egyptians to take them down the
   [88]Nile River. Architect Hunt, later famous for his [89]Gilded Age
   Newport palazzos, painted and made sketches along the Nile while his
   younger brother and Baker took photographs. (The results were later
   shown at a 1999 exhibition in Washington, D.C.)

   Following their arduous journey, the pair of no-longer-neophyte
   photographers returned to Paris and made prints from their 18x24 cm
   negatives which were made using a waxed-paper process.^[90][3] Having
   developed the negatives, each man kept a personal album of the prints.
   The young Hunt showed his to the German naturalist and explorer
   [91]Alexander von Humboldt, who brought them to the attention of the
   [92]King of Prussia, and Hunt made a formal gift of 11 prints to
   [93]Karl Richard Lepsius, the German founder of the study of ancient
   Egyptology.^[94][4] Baker left his album with a New York dealer to
   discern commercial interest in the prints.

   Following their extraordinary journey, the two men took divergent
   paths. Baker returned to [95]Cincinnati, Ohio, to enjoy the life of a
   wealthy aesthete, while Hunt completed his studies at the Swiss
   Military Institute, then returned to America where he took a second law
   degree, this one from Harvard.^[96][5] He began practicing law in
   [97]New York City, the home of his brother Richard Morris Hunt, until
   the outbreak of the [98]American Civil War, when he enlisted as
   lieutenant on the staff of General [99]Heintzelman. Eventually he was
   promoted to lieutenant colonel for bravery at the [100]Battle of
   Malvern Hill.^[101][6] Hunt subsequently attained the rank of full
   [102]colonel and assistant [103]adjutant general in the [104]Union
   Army.^[105][7]

   Following the Civil War, Leavitt Hunt returned to New York City and his
   law practice for several years, until he retired in 1867 to
   [106]Weathersfield, Vermont, where his wife Katherine Jarvis ^[107][8]
   had inherited the estate belonging to her father [108]William Jarvis, a
   prominent Vermont businessman and diplomat best known as the first
   importer of [109]Merino sheep into America.

   Leavitt Hunt purchased his own estate at nearby [110]Weathersfield Bow
   and became a gentleman farmer.^[111][4] Hunt was particularly
   interested in the rare breeds of Dutch cattle that he raised,^[112][9]
   as well as the white pine forests he propagated on his estate, which he
   dubbed Elmsholme.^[113][10] During his retirement as a farmer, Hunt
   also became an inventor,^[114][11] with several patents for new
   plows.^[115][12]^[116][13]

   As far as is known, neither Hunt nor his companion Baker ever showed
   much interest in the photographic medium after their journey. Their
   prints are rarely seen, very scarce, and are among the most valuable
   early photographic images. Hunt's personal album is now in the
   collection of the Bennington Art Museum, [117]Bennington, Vermont.
   Baker's album evidently disappeared. The collection of photos presented
   to Eygptologist Richard Lepsius is housed at the [118]Museum Ludwig's
   [119]AgfaPhoto-Historama in [120]Cologne, Germany.

   Hunt's personal negatives are believed lost, but the prints he made
   became the property of his brother Richard Morris Hunt. They are now
   preserved in the Richard Morris Hunt Papers at the American
   Architectural Foundation in [122]Washington, D.C. A 1999 show at the
   American Architectural Foundation's [123]Octagon Museum showcased
   Leavitt Hunt's 1853 journey. Entitled "A Voyage of Discovery: The Nile
   Journal of Richard Morris Hunt", the exhibition consisted of seventy of
   Leavitt Hunt's original photographic prints, as well as drawings and
   watercolors by Richard Morris Hunt from the museum's Prints and
   Drawings Collection.^[124][14]

   Some of Leavitt Hunt's personal prints were donated by his family after
   his death to the [125]Library of Congress, where they are part of the
   permanent photographic collection.^[126][15] There are also a few
   original prints from this early Middle East trip in the [127]Hallmark
   Photographic Collection and at the [128]George Eastman House in
   [129]Rochester, New York. [130]Harvard University's Harrison D. Horblit
   Collection of Early Photography also owns several of the works by Hunt
   and Baker.

   Although Leavitt Hunt never returned to photography, he remained
   vitally interested in the arts until the end of his life, corresponding
   with fellow Harvard-educated lawyer and author [131]Henry Dwight
   Sedgwick, as well as other intellectuals of the era.^[132][16] He and
   his wife travelled frequently, often crossing paths with family friends
   like [133]Joseph Hodges Choate and Thomas Jefferson Coolidge.^[134][17]
   He also wrote poetry on the side.^[135][18]

   Perhaps the highest tribute paid Leavitt Hunt and his brothers was that
   of [136]Ralph Waldo Emerson. "The remarkable families", Emerson wrote,
   were "the three Jackson brothers....the three Lowell brothers....the
   four Lawrences....the Cabots....the three Hunts, William, Richard and
   Leavitt (William Hunt tells also of his brother John, in Paris); the
   Washburns, three governors, I believe."^[137][19]

   their trip down the [140]Nile, 1853

   Clyde du Vernet Hunt, who graduated from [141]Andover and [142]Harvard
   Law School, and subsequently became a painter and sculptor accepted by
   the [143]Paris Salon,^[144][20] was the son of Leavitt Hunt and his
   wife, the former Katherine Jarvis.^[145][21]^[146][22] A portrait of
   Leavitt Hunt painted by his brother William Morris Hunt in 1874 is in
   the permanent collection of the Brooks Memorial Library, Brattleboro's
   main library.^[147][23] Artist William Morris Hunt sketched other
   members of his brother Leavitt's family as well.^[148][24] [149]Jarvis
   Hunt, another son of Col. Hunt and his wife, became a noted Chicago
   architect.^[150][25]

   Leavitt Hunt's wife Katherine, daughter of businessman William Jarvis,
   died June 6, 1916, at [151]Lakewood, New Jersey, and was interred with
   her husband at Weathersfield.^[152][26] Leavitt Hunt predeceased his
   wife, dying at Weathersfield on February 16, 1907. The couple's infant
   son Morris Hunt, who died in 1871, is interred with his
   parents.^[153][27]

       triangular cross-sails. The rear of the boat sported a cabin, where
       the chartering party could sleep. Typically, they took their meals
       on the roof of the cabin under a large awning. This means of
       conveyance was typically used by English and other foreign tourists
       on the Nile in the nineteenth century. The crew consisted of a
       dozen or more men, who cooked, captained the vessel and shopped in
       the bazaars for supplies.
