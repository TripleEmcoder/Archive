[[31]edit] Biography

   Robert Paxton McCulloch was born May 11, 1911, in [32]Missouri. His
   grandfather, [33]John I. Beggs, made his fortune by implementing
   [34]Thomas Edison’s electrical powerplants in cities around the world,
   manufacturing and selling [35]electric trolley cars, and founding
   Milwaukee’s public utility system. McCulloch, along with his [36]two
   siblings, inherited his grandfather’s fortune in 1925.^[37][1]

   Two years after he graduated from [38]Stanford University, he married
   Barbra Ann Briggs, whose father was [39]Stephen Foster Briggs of
   [40]Briggs and Stratton. His first manufacturing endeavor was McCulloch
   Engineering Company, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There he built
   racing engines and superchargers. In his early 30s, he sold the company
   to [41]Borg-Warner Corporation for [42]US$1 million.^[43][2]

   McCulloch then started [44]McCulloch Aviation; and, in 1946, he changed
   his company’s name to [45]McCulloch Motors Corporation. Building small
   gasoline engines, his competitors included his in-laws and [46]Ralph
   Evinrude. [47]Evinrude led the market for boat motors, while Briggs and
   Stratton pulled ahead in the [48]lawn mower and garden tractor market.

[[49]edit] Chainsaws

   It was the chainsaw niche that McCulloch dominated, beginning with the
   first chainsaw with his name on it, manufactured in 1948. McCulloch's
   chainsaw was used to cut frozen lake ice into large cubes as well as
   trees into lumber. By the next year, McCulloch’s 3-25 further
   revolutionized the market, with the one man, light weight
   chainsaw.^[50][2]

   In the 1950s, McCulloch started [51]McCulloch Oil Corporation, which
   pursued oil and gas exploration, land development and geothermal
   energy.

   In spite of Evinrude’s market lead, McCulloch continued to pursue
   McCulloch Motors’ quest for the outboard market during the next decade.
   This led him to Lake Havasu in search of a test site. McCulloch
   purchased 3,500 acres (14 km^2) of lakeside property along Pittsburgh
   Point. In 1963, on the courthouse steps of [52]Kingman, Arizona,
   McCulloch purchased a 26 square miles (67 km^2) parcel of barren
   desert, that would become the site for Lake Havasu City. At the time it
   was the largest single tract of state land ever sold in
   Arizona^[53][2], and the cost per acre was under US$75.

   To spur the growth of the infant city, in 1964 McCulloch opened a
   chainsaw manufacturing plant in the new community. Within two years
   there were three manufacturing plants, with some 400 employees.^[54][2]

[[55]edit] Purchase of London Bridge

   Main article: [56]London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)

   In 1968, McCulloch was searching for a unique attraction for his city,
   which eventually took him to [57]London. By the early 1960s it was
   apparent that [58]John Rennie's 1831 [59]London Bridge was gradually
   sinking into the [60]River Thames and the [61]City of London
   Corporation decided that a new bridge would need to be built. Rather
   than demolish the existing bridge, they decided to put the historic
   landmark on the auction block.

   When casting his bid for the bridge, McCulloch doubled the estimated
   cost of dismantling the structure, which was US$1.2 million, bringing
   the price to US$2.4 million. He then added on US$60,000, a thousand
   dollars for each year of his age at the time he estimated the bridge
   would be raised in Arizona^[62][2]. His gesture earned him the winning
   bid, although there was very little competition.^[63][3]
   Numbered stones can still be seen at [64]London Bridge in [65]Lake
   Havasu City, Arizona

   It took three years to complete the project. The structure was
   dismantled block by block, with each section marked and numbered, in
   much the same way the bridge was originally built. The granite pieces
   were stacked at the Surrey Commercial Docks, and then were shipped
   through the [66]Panama Canal, to [67]Long Beach, California. From Long
   Beach, the [68]granite blocks were trucked inland 300 miles (500 km).
   The bridge was reassembled by matching the numbered stones and filling
   in the area under the bridge with mounds of desert sand to support each
   arch as it was reconstructed.

   The reconstructed attraction was officially opened on October 10, 1971,
   with a gala celebration. Opening day included an elaborate fanfare:
   fireworks, a parade, entertainment, and celebrities, such as
   [69]Bonanza's [70]Lorne Greene, and dignitaries such as the Lord Mayor
   of London.^[71][2]

   With the purchase of the bridge, McCulloch accelerated his development
   campaign, increasing the number of flights into the city. At the time,
   the airport was located on the island. The free flights to Lake Havasu
   lasted until 1978, and reportedly they totalled 2,702 flights, bringing
   in 37,000 prospective buyers.^[72][2]

   A popular urban legend is that McCulloch mistakenly believed that he
   was buying the more impressive [73]Tower Bridge. London bridge had been
   heavily marketed by the London Council in an effort to sell it
   worldwide. [74]Ivan Luckin, the council member who sold the bridge has
   always stated that London sold the bridge honestly.^[75][3]

[[76]edit] Death

   He died February 25, 1977, in [77]Los Angeles.

[[94]edit] Other inventions

   McCulloch also developed a [95]centrifugal supercharger for
   [96]automotive use. At first, these were produced and sold under the
   McCulloch name; but, in 1956, the supercharger division was renamed
   [97]Paxton Superchargers. Such notable cars as the 1954-55 [98]Kaiser
   Manhattan and the 1957 [99]Studebaker Golden Hawk and [100]Ford
   Thunderbird F-Type had a McCulloch/Paxton Supercharger. The
   supercharger was also used as a CO[2] Scrubber on Navy Submarines. The
   company produced one prototype automobile, with a hard top that
   retracted over the trunk, the [101]Paxton Phoenix. The 1953 vehicle
   promoted alternative fuels and had a proposed steam engine. The
   division was sold in 1958, becoming [102]Paxton Automotive. The firm is
   still in business.

   McCulloch’s diverse interests continued into the last years of his
   life. In 1971, the same year the [103]London Bridge officially opened,
   he built his first aircraft in Lake Havasu City. It was the
   [104]McCulloch J-2 Gyroplane, a hybrid combination of helicopter and
   airplane, and was tested by NASA pilot James Patton, in the summer of
   1973. His dream was to offer "an airplane in every garage", promoting a
   seemingly simple aircraft that was easy to fly and could take off from
   a driveway. Although he manufactured about 100 of the aircraft, the
   market never materialized.
