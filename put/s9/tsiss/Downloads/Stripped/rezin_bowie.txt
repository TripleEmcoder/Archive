Rezin Bowie

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: [5]navigation, [6]search

   Rezin Pleasant Bowie (September 8, 1793 – January 17, 1841) was an
   American inventor and designer of the [7]Bowie knife. He also served
   three terms in the [8]Louisiana Legislature.

   With his brother [9]James, Bowie smuggled slaves and worked as a land
   speculator. The brothers set up the first steam mill in Louisiana to be
   used for grinding sugar cane. Bowie took credit for inventing the Bowie
   knife, which came to prominence when used by James in the [10]Sandbar
   Fight in 1827. After James Bowie moved to [11]Texas, Bowie accompanied
   him on an expedition to find the Lost San Saba Mine. They did not find
   the mine, but their adventures in fending off a much larger Indian
   raiding party became widely known.

   In his later years Bowie suffered from poor eyesight. He lived with his
   wife and daughters on a plantation in Louisiana.

[[19]edit] Early years

   Rezin Bowie was born September 8, 1793, near [20]Gallatin,
   Tennessee,^[21][1] one of ten children born to Rezin Bowie and Elve
   Ap-Catesby Jones.^[22][2] Bowie was one of twins, with brother
   Rhesa.^[23][1] His father had been injured while fighting in the
   [24]American Revolution, and, in 1782, married the young woman who had
   nursed him back to health. The Bowies moved a great deal, first
   settling in Georgia, where they had six children, and then moving to
   Tennessee.^[25][2] The year after Bowie's birth, the family moved to
   [26]Logan County, Kentucky.^[27][1] By 1796, his father owned 8 slaves,
   7 horses, 11 head of cattle, and 1 stud horse. The following year the
   family acquired 200 [28]acres (80 [29]ha) along the [30]Red River. In
   1800, Rezin Bowie sold his property and the family spent two years in
   [31]Missouri. They moved to [32]Spanish Louisiana in 1802, settling on
   the Bushley Bayou in [33]Rapides Parish.^[34][2]

   The Bowie family moved again in 1809, settling on [35]Bayou Teche in
   [36]Louisiana before finding a permanent home in [37]Opelousas, in St.
   Landry Parish, in 1812.^[38][3] Each of their homes was on the
   frontier, and even as a small child Bowie was expected to help clear
   the land and plant crops. He and his siblings were educated at home,
   and learned to read and write in English. With his younger brother
   [39]James, Bowie learned to speak, read, and write [40]Spanish and
   [41]French fluently.^[42][4] The children were also taught how to
   survive on the frontier, as well as how to fish and run a farm and
   plantation.^[43][5]

   Bowie converted to [44]Roman Catholicism in 1814 and married Margaret
   Nevil in the [45]St. Landry Parish Catholic Church on September 15,
   1814. Later that year he and James enlisted in the Louisiana militia in
   response to [46]Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers to fight the
   British. The [47]War of 1812 ended on December 24, 1814 with the
   signing of the [48]Treaty of Ghent, and the Bowie brothers arrived in
   [49]New Orleans too late to participate in the fighting.^[50][6] Bowie
   later joined the Avoyelles Battalion, and was commissioned a captain of
   the Mounted Rifles in 1825, later becoming a colonel.^[51][1]

[[52]edit] Land speculator

   Shortly before Bowie's father died in 1818 or 1819 he gifted Bowie and
   his brother James each 10 servants, horses, and cattle. For the next
   seven years the brothers worked together to develop several large
   estates in [53]Lafourche Parish and Opelousas Parish.^[54][7] Louisiana
   was gaining population rapidly, and the brothers wished to take
   advantage of rising land prices by speculating in land but did not have
   the capital required to buy large tracts.^[55][8] To raise money they
   entered into partnership with pirate [56]Jean Lafitte in 1818. The
   United States had previously [57]outlawed the importation of slaves,
   and, to encourage citizens to report the unlawful activity, most
   southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to
   receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction. They
   made three trips to Lafitte's compound on [58]Galveston Island, where
   they bought smuggled slaves, then brought the slaves directly to a
   customhouse and informed on himself. The customs officers offered the
   slaves for auction, and the Bowies would buy them back. Due to the
   state laws, they would receive half of the price paid. They could then
   legally transport the slaves and resell them in [59]New Orleans or
   areas further up the [60]Mississippi River.^[61][9]^[62][10] The
   brothers continued this scheme until they had collected $65,000, then
   began speculating in land.^[63][10]^[64][11]

   In 1825, the two brothers joined with their younger brother Stephen to
   buy Acadia, a plantation near [65]Thibodaux. Within two years they had
   set up the first steam mill in Louisiana to be used for grinding sugar
   cane.^[66][7] The plantation became known as a "model estate", but on
   February 12, 1831 they sold it and 65 slaves for $90,000. With their
   profits, Bowie and James bought a plantation in [67]Arkansas.^[68][7]
   In this time period Bowie served in the [69]Louisiana legislature three
   times.^[70][1]

[[71]edit] Bowie knife

   One afternoon in 1826, Bowie's brother James was attacked by the
   sheriff of Rapides Parish, Norris Wright, after a confrontation in
   [72]Alexandria. James Bowie vowed from then on to carry a hunting knife
   on his person at all times.^[73][12] The knife he carried had a huge
   blade that was nine and one-quarter inches long and one and one-half
   inches wide.^[74][13]
   A [75]Bowie knife

   The following year, on September 19, 1827, James Bowie and Wright
   attended a duel on a sandbar outside of [76]Natchez, Mississippi,
   supporting opposing sides. The duel was resolved with a
   handshake,^[77][14]^[78][15] but other members of the groups, who had
   various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. James Bowie
   suffered several serious injuries, and was repeatedly shot and stabbed,
   but managed to pull his knife and use it to disembowel Wright, who died
   instantly.^[79][16]^[80][17]

   Newspapers picked up the story, which became known as the [81]Sandbar
   Fight. Bowie's fighting prowess and his knife were described in
   detail.^[82][18] There is disagreement among scholars as to whether the
   knife used in this fight was the same kind of knife now known as a
   [83]Bowie knife. Many different accounts exist of who designed and
   built the first Bowie knife. Some claim that James Bowie designed it
   and others attribute the design to noted knifemakers of the
   time.^[84][19] However, in a letter to The Planter's Advocate, Bowie
   claimed to have invented the knife,^[85][20] and many Bowie family
   members and "most authorities on the Bowie knife tend to believe it was
   invented by" Bowie.^[86][21] His grandchildren, however, claimed that
   Bowie merely supervised his blacksmith, who actually created the
   knife.^[87][22]

   After the Sandbar Fight and subsequent battles in which James Bowie
   successfully used his knife to defend himself, his knife became very
   popular. Many craftsman and manufacturers made their own versions of
   the knife, and many major cities of the [88]Southwest had "Bowie knife
   schools", which taught "the art of cut, thrust, and parry."^[89][23]
   His fame, and that of his knife, spread to England, and by the early
   1830s many British knife manufacturers were producing Bowie knives,
   shipping many of them to the United States for sale.^[90][24] The
   design of the knife continued to evolve, and it is generally agreed to
   have a blade 8.25 inches long and 1.25 inches wide, with a curved
   point. It had a "sharp false edge cut from both sides" and a
   cross-guard to protect the user's hands.^[91][25]

[[92]edit] Lost San Saba Mine

   James Bowie moved to [93]Texas in 1830 and became fascinated with the
   story of the "[94]lost" Los Almagres Mine, said to be west of [95]San
   Antonio near the ruin of Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission.^[96][13] The
   mine had been operated by the local Indians before being seized by the
   Spanish. After [97]Mexico won independence from Spain, government
   interest in the mines waned. A number of hostile Indian tribes roamed
   the area, including [98]Comanche, [99]Lipan Apache, and [100]Karankawa,
   and without government troops to keep the tribes at bay, mining ceased.
   It was believed that after the Mexican citizens left the area, the
   Lipan Apaches took over the mines.^[101][26]

   On November 2, 1831, Bowie accompanied his brother and nine others on a
   search for San Saba. Six miles (ten kilometers) from their goal the
   group realized that they were being followed by a large Indian raiding
   party and stopped to negotiate. The attempts at parley failed, and
   Bowie and his group were forced to fight for their lives for the next
   thirteen hours. When the Indians finally retreated Bowie had reportedly
   lost only one man, while over forty Indians had been killed and thirty
   more wounded.^[102][11]^[103][13]^[104][27]

   In 1832, Bowie began having trouble with his vision. Accompanied by his
   brother James, he travelled to [105]New York, [106]Philadelphia, and
   [107]Washington, D.C. to seek medical treatment. While in Philadelphia,
   the publisher of the [108]Saturday Evening Post persuaded Bowie to
   write an account of the San Saba fight, which was reprinted in 1833 in
   the book Atkinson's Casket or Gems of Literature, Wit and
   Sentiment.^[109][1]

[[110]edit] Later years

   After returning home, Bowie and his family moved to a plantation in
   [111]Iberville Parish. While there, Bowie, along with General John
   Wilson, acquired the papers of Captain Vicente Sebastian Pintado, the
   royal surveyor for the Spanish government. Pintado had kept his surveys
   and records of deeds and grants in the [112]Louisiana Territory as his
   personal property and refused to sell them to the [113]United States.
   After Pintado's death, his widow sold the papers to Bowie and Wilson
   for $24,500 (the United States declined to pay the high price). Bowie
   wanted the papers to help him in his land speculation dealings, but it
   is unknown whether he derived any benefits from them.^[114][1]

   Bowie died in New Orleans on January 17, 1841, leaving his wife and
   three daughters. He was originally buried in the San Gabriel Catholic
   Church cemetery, but in the 1850s his body was disinterred and reburied
   at St. Joseph Catholic Cemetery in [115]Port Gibson, Mississippi, the
   home of his daughter Elve.^[116][1]
