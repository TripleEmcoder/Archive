   Pliny Earle I (December 17, 1762 – November 19, 1832) was an
   [19]American [20]inventor who made wool and cotton [21]carding
   machines.

   He was born in 1762 in [22]Leicester, Massachusetts.

   He was a descendant of [23]Ralph Earle, who petitioned [24]Charles I of
   England, in 1638, for a charter to form themselves into [25]Rhode
   Island.

   In 1785, he teamed with Edmund Snow in the manufacture of [26]carding
   machines for cotton and wool. Among the many obstacles encountered by
   [27]Samuel Slater in the introduction into the United States of the
   manufacture of cotton by machinery was the difficulty of procuring card
   clothing for his machines.

   After unsuccessful applications to several other persons, he went, in
   1790, to Earle, who, although it was a new and untried work, agreed to
   make the cards. He succeeded, but to achieve that success he was
   obliged to prick the holes for the teeth with two needles fastened in
   handle. This led him to the invention of the machine for pricking
   "twilled" cards, by which the labor of a man for fifteen hours could be
   performed in as many minutes. This machine was in general use for
   years, until the machine that both pricks the leather and sets the
   teeth superseded it. He was a member of the [28]Society of Friends,
   and, apart from his inventive genius, made extensive attainments in
   science and literature.

   Earle subsequently took little part in political affairs. He devoted
   his time principally to literary work, and published an "Essay on Penal
   Law" ; an "Essay on the Rights of States to Alter and to Annul their
   Charters"; "Treatise on Railroads and Internal Communications" (1830)
   and a" Life of Benjamin Lundy." At the time of his death he was engaged
   in a translation of Sismondis "Italian Republics," and in the
   compilation of a "Grammatical Dictionary of the French and the English
   Languages."
