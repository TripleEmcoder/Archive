       Joseph Engelberger
      Born    July 26, 1925
              [7]New York City
   Occupation [8]engineer
   Known for  [9]Robotics

   Joseph F. Engelberger (born in [10]New York City, July 26, 1925) is a
   physicist, [11]engineer and [12]entrepreneur who is referred to as the
   "Father of [13]Robotics".^[14][1]^[15][2] Licensing the original patent
   awarded to inventor [16]George Devol, Engelberger developed the first
   [17]industrial robot in the United States, the [18]Unimate, in the
   1950s. Later he worked as entrepreneur and vocal advocate of robotic
   technology beyond the manufacturing plant in a variety of fields,
   including service industries, health care, and space exploration.

[[19]edit] Biography

   In 1956, Engelberger founded Unimation Inc., which was the world's
   first robotics company. Two years earlier Devol had already secured the
   [20]patents for the robot technology. The first industrial robot was
   installed at [21]General Motors in 1961. Over the next two decades, the
   Japanese took the lead by investing heavily in robots to replace people
   performing certain tasks. In Japan, Engelberger is widely hailed as a
   key player in the postwar ascendancy of Japanese manufacturing quality
   and efficiency.^[[22]citation needed]

   In 1966, Engelberger and a Unimate robot appeared on [23]The Tonight
   Show Starring Johnny Carson. In the segment, the robot poured a beer,
   sank a golf putt, and directed the band.

   The [24]Robotics Industries Association annually presents the
   [25]Joseph F. Engelberger Awards to "persons who have contributed
   outstandingly to the furtherance of the science and practice of
   robotics." The 2000 World Automation Congress was dedicated to
   Engelberger, who delivered the [26]keynote address.

   An early proponent of increased investment in robotic systems,
   Engelberger published articles and gave Congressional testimony on the
   value of using automation in space long before successes of the
   [27]NASA's Mars landers, Galileo, and other unmanned space science
   missions.

   Engelberger's 1980 book, Robotics in Practice ([28]ISBN 9780814475874),
   has been translated into six languages. This was followed by Robotics
   in Service ([29]ISBN 9780262050425) in 1989.

   Engelberger was elected to the [30]National Academy of Engineering in
   1984. Additional honors include the Progress Award of the [31]Society
   of Manufacturing Engineers, the Leonardo da Vinci Award of the
   [32]American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the 1982 American
   Machinist Award, the McKechnie Award from the [33]University of
   Liverpool, the Egleston Medal from [34]Columbia University, the 1997
   Beckman Award for pioneering and original research in the field of
   automation, and the 1997 Japan Prize, the highest Japanese technology
   honor, for the establishment of the robot industry.

   Engelberger received his [35]B.S. and [36]M.S. degrees from
   [37]Columbia University, in 1946 and 1949, respectively. Between 1946
   and 1956, he was an engineer with [38]Manning, Maxwell and Moore. In
   1957, he founded Consolidated Controls Corporation. In 1962 he founded
   Unimation Inc., and served as chief executive until it was acquired by
   [39]Westinghouse in 1982. In 1984, he founded Transitions Research
   Corporation which became HelpMate Robotics Inc. HelpMate was acquired
   by [40]Cardinal Health in 1997. In his more recent work, Engelberger
   has focussed on mobile, sensate robots can work with human mentors in
   service activities. The HelpMate, a robotic hospital courier, is the
   most widely known and has been installed in over dozens of hospitals
   around the world. Engelberger has been active in the promotion and
   development of robots for use in [41]elder care.
