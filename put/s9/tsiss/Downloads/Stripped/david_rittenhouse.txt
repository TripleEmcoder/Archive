[[31]edit] Biography

   Rittenhouse was born near [32]Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
   in a small village called [33]RittenhouseTown. This village is located
   along the stream [34]Paper Mill Run; the stream itself a tiny tributary
   of the [35]Wissahickon Creek.

   When his uncle died, Rittenhouse inherited his uncle's set of carpentry
   tools and instructional books. He used these tools and began a career
   as an inventor. At a young age, Rittenhouse showed a high level of
   intelligence by creating a working scale model of his grandfather's
   paper mill. He was [36]self-taught and showed great ability in
   [37]science and [38]mathematics.

   When Rittenhouse was 13 years of age, he had mastered [39]Isaac
   Newton's [40]laws of motion and [41]gravity. As a young boy he loved to
   build scale models, such as a working waterwheel and a paper mill.
   Rittenhouse never went to elementary school and was completely
   self-educated from family books.

   When he was 19, he started a scientific instrument shop at his father's
   farm in what is now [42]East Norriton Township, Pennsylvania. His skill
   with instruments, particularly clocks, led him to construct two
   [43]orreries (scale models of the solar system) for [44]Rutgers
   University in [45]New Jersey. In return for the gift, the college gave
   him a scholarship to attend the college enabling him to obtain a degree
   in philosophy. One of the orreries is currently in the library of the
   [46]University of Pennsylvania and the other is at Peyton Hall of
   [47]Princeton University.

   At the age of 28, he published his first mathematical paper; this is
   one of many papers published throughout his life.

   Rittenhouse was one of the first to build a telescope in the United
   States. His telescope, which utilized natural [48]spider silk to form
   the [49]reticle, was used to observe and record part of the [50]transit
   of Venus across the sun on June 3, 1769, as well as the planet's
   atmosphere.

   In 1781 Rittenhouse became the first American to sight
   [51]Uranus.^[52][1]

   In 1784 Rittenhouse, surveyor [53]Andrew Ellicott and their crew
   completed the unfinished survey of the [54]Mason Dixon line to the
   southwest corner of Pennsylvania, 5 degrees of longitude from the
   Delaware River.

   In 1785 Rittenhouse made perhaps the first [55]diffraction grating
   using 50 hairs between two finely-threaded screws, with an approximate
   spacing of about 100 lines per inch. This was roughly the same
   technique that [56]Joseph von Fraunhofer used in 1821 for his wire
   diffraction grating.

   In 1813 Rittenhouse's nephew (and American Philosophical Society
   member) [57]William Barton published a biography, Memoirs of the life
   of David Rittenhouse.^[58][2] Former [59]president [60]Thomas Jefferson
   ordered six copies directly from the author.

[[61]edit] Clubs and societies

   Astronomers who had been studying the planet [62]Venus chose
   Rittenhouse to study the transit path of Venus in 1769 and its
   atmosphere. Rittenhouse was the perfect person to study the mysterious
   planet, as he had a personal observatory on his family farm. "His
   telescope, which he made himself, utilized grating intervals and spider
   threads on the focus of the telescope." His telescope is very similar
   to some modern-day telescopes. Rittenhouse served on the [63]American
   Astronomical Society, and this was another factor in being chosen to
   study Venus. Throughout his life he had the honour to serve in many
   different clubs and committees.

   In 1768 he was elected to membership in the [64]American Philosophical
   Society. He served as librarian, secretary, and after [65]Benjamin
   Franklin's death, he became Vice president.^[66][3] Following the death
   of Franklin in 1790, Rittenhouse served as president of the American
   Philosophical Society until 1796.^[67][4]^[68][5]

   Another one of his interests was the [69]Royal Society of London of
   which he was a member. It was very rare for an American to be a member
   of this exclusive British society.

   In 1786 Rittenhouse built a new Georgian-style house on the corner of
   4th and Arch streets in Philadelphia, next to an octagonal observatory
   he had already built. At this house, he maintained a Wednesday evening
   salon meeting with Benjamin Franklin, Francis Hopkinson, [70]Pierre
   Eugene du Simitiere and others. Thomas Jefferson wrote that he would
   rather attend one of these meetings "than spend a whole week in
   Paris."^[71][6]

[[72]edit] Family

   David Rittenhouse was married twice. He married Eleanor Coulston
   February 20, 1766, and they had two daughters: Elizabeth (born 1767)
   and Ester (born 1769). David's first wife Eleanor died February 23,
   1771, at age 35 from complications during the birth of their third
   baby, who died at birth.

   David married his second wife Hannah Jacobs on December 31, 1772. They
   had an unnamed baby, who died at birth in late 1773. Hannah outlived
   David by more than 3 years, dying in late 1799.

   David's grandson (son of Ester) was named David Rittenhouse
   Waters.^[73][7]

[[74]edit] Notable contributions to the United States

   David Rittenhouse made many breakthroughs during his life, which were
   great contributions to the [75]U.S.. During the first part of his
   career he was a surveyor for [76]Great Britain, and later served in the
   [77]Pennsylvania government. His 1763-1764 survey of the
   Delaware-Pennsylvania border was a 12-mile circle about the Court House
   in New Castle, Delaware, to define the northern border of Delaware.
   Rittenhouse's work was so precise and well-documented that it was
   incorporated without modification into [78]Charles Mason and
   [79]Jeremiah Dixon's survey of the Pennsylvania-Maryland border.

   Later Rittenhouse would help establish the boundaries of several other
   states and commonwealths both before and after the Independence,
   including the boundaries between New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.
   In 1763 Mason and Dixon began a survey of the Pennsylvania-Maryland
   border, but this work was interrupted in 1767. In 1784 Rittenhouse and
   [80]Andrew Ellicott completed this survey of the Mason-Dixon line to
   the southwest corner of Pennsylvania. When Rittenhouse's work as a
   surveyor ended, he resumed his scientific interests.

[[81]edit] Transit of Venus

   In 1768 the same year that he became a member of the [82]American
   Philosophical Society, Rittenhouse announced plans to observe a pending
   transit of [83]Venus across the [84]Sun from several locations. The
   American Philosophical Society persuaded the legislature to grant £100
   towards the purchase of new telescopes, and members volunteered to man
   half of the 22 telescope stations when the event
   arrived.^[85][1]^[86][8]

   The [87]transit of Venus occurred on 3 June 1769. Rittenhouse's great
   excitement at observing the infrequently occurring transit of Venus
   (for which he had prepared for a year) resulted in his fainting during
   the observation. In addition to the work involved in the preparations,
   he had also been ill the week before the transit. Lying on his back
   beneath the telescope, trained at the afternoon sun, he regained
   consciousness after a few minutes and continued his observations. His
   account of the transit, published in the American Philosophical
   Society's Transactions, does not mention his fainting, though it is
   otherwise meticulous in its record and docomented.

   Rittenhouse used the observations to calculate the distance from Earth
   to the Sun to be 93-million miles.^[88][1] (This is the approximate
   average distance between Earth and the Sun.) The published report of
   the transit was hailed by European scientists, and Rittenhouse would
   correspond with famous contemporary astronomers, such as [89]Jérôme
   Lalande and [90]Franz Xaver von Zach.^[91][1]

[[92]edit] Orrery

   In 1770 Rittenhouse completed an advanced [93]orrery. In recognition of
   the achievement, the [94]College of New Jersey granted Rittenhouse an
   honorary degree.^[95][8] The college then acquired ownership of the
   orrery. Rittenhouse made a new, more advanced model which remained in
   Philadelphia. The State of Pennsylvania paid Rittenhouse £300 as a
   tribute for his achievement.^[96][9]

   Rittenhouse was admired by many colonial Americans and scientists,
   including Dr. Benjamin Franklin, [97]Thomas Jefferson,^[98][9] and
   [99]John Adams.^[100][8] On February 24, 1775, Rittenhouse delivered a
   lecture on the history of astronomy to the American Philosophical
   Society, in which he linked the structure of nature to the rights of
   man, liberty and self-government.^[101][9]^[102][10] Rittenhouse also
   used the occasion to decry slavery.^[103][11] So impressed were those
   in attendance that the American Philosophical Society commissioned the
   speech to be printed and distributed to delegates of the [104]Second
   Continental Congress when they arrived in 1776.^[105][11]^[106][12]

[[107]edit] United States Mint

   The 1783 Nova Constellatio coin was first minted in Philadelphia. David
   Rittenhouse was consulted on the design.^[108][11]

   David Rittenhouse was [109]treasurer of Pennsylvania from 1777–1789,
   and with these skills and the help of [110]George Washington, he became
   the first director of the [111]United States Mint.^[112][13] On April
   2, 1792, the United States Mint opened its doors, but would not produce
   coins for almost four months. Rittenhouse believed that the design of
   the coin made the coin a piece of artwork. The first coins were made
   from flatware that was provided by Washington himself on the morning of
   July 30, 1792. The coins were hand-struck by Rittenhouse, to test the
   new equipment, and were given to Washington as a token of appreciation
   for his contributions to making the [113]United States Mint a reality.
   The coin design had not been approved by Congress. Coin production on a
   large scale did not begin until 1793. Rittenhouse resigned from the
   Mint on June 30, 1795, due to poor health. In 1871 Congress approved a
   [114]commemorative coin in his honor.

[[127]edit] Tributes to David Rittenhouse

     * [128]Rittenhouse Crater is a lunar crater named for David
       Rittenhouse.

   The blue field of stars in the American flag may be a tribute to the
   work of David Rittenhouse^[[129]citation needed]
     * In 1825, one of [130]William Penn's original squares in
       Philadelphia, called 'Southwest Square' (being in the southwest
       quadrant of the original city plan) was renamed [131]Rittenhouse
       Square in David Rittenhouse's honor.

     * To the west of Rittenhouse Square, on Walnut Street, the
       [132]University of Pennsylvania houses its [133]Physics and
       [134]Mathematics departments in the [135]David Rittenhouse
       Laboratory.

     * One admirer and colleague of Rittenhouse, [136]Francis Hopkinson,
       was on the Navy Board that wrote the [137]Flag Act of 1777, which
       defined the [138]Flag of the United States of America and explained
       the blue field of stars as a representation of "a new
       constellation." This is thought by some^[[139]who?]^[[140]citation
       needed] to be a direct tribute to Rittenhouse. Biographer Brooke
       Hindle wrote, "Few admired Rittenhouse more unrestrainedly than
       Francis Hopkinson."^[141][6]
