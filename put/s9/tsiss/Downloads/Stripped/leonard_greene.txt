   Leonard Michael Greene (June 8, 1918 – November 30, 2006) was an
   American [25]inventor and [26]aerodynamics [27]engineer who held more
   than 200 [28]patents, many of which are aviation-related. He is most
   well known for his contributions to [29]aviation [30]technology,
   including his invention, the Aircraft Stall Warning device, which warns
   pilots when a deadly aerodynamic [31]stall is imminent. To build the
   device, Greene established the [32]Safe Flight Instrument Corporation
   in 1946.

   Apart from his inventive life, Greene also served as the founder and
   president of the [33]Institute for Socioeconomic Studies, a think tank
   to address issues such as poverty and social awareness. Additionally,
   he co-founded the [34]Corporate Angel Network, a [35]charitable
   organization that flies patients in corporate aircraft. In 1991, he was
   inducted into the [36]National Inventors Hall of Fame. Greene died on
   November 30, 2006 at the age of 88 in [37]Mamaroneck, New York. The
   cause was complications from [38]lung cancer.

[[55]edit] Early life & family

   Leonard M. Greene was born in [56]New York City on June 8, 1918. Max
   Greene, his chemist father, and Lyn Furman Greene, his artist mother,
   encouraged their son to create his own toys. His parents made him a
   gift of their old stove, which he could take apart. Greene experienced
   [57]poverty as a youth during the [58]Depression and never forgot it.

   Greene first married Beverly Kaufman, with whom he had three children;
   this, however, ended in divorce. Then, he adopted four children of his
   second wife, Phyllis Saks Greene, with whom he had another child.
   Phyllis Saks Greene, an heiress of the [59]Saks Fifth Avenue department
   store family, died in 1965. Greene’s third marriage was to Joyce Teck
   Meller in 1967, which also ended up in divorce in 2005.

   A son from the second marriage, [60]Donald Greene, died [61]Sept. 11,
   2001, abroad [62]United Airlines Flight 93 when it crashed in
   [63]Pennsylvania.

[[64]edit] Education

   Leonard Greene graduated in 1938 from the [65]City College of New York
   with a [66]B.S. in [67]Chemistry, and went on to receive a [68]M.S. in
   [69]aeronautical engineering. He received a [70]pilot’s license at the
   age of 19 and later did postgraduate work in aeronautics at the
   [71]Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at [72]New York University.

   In 1977, he was awarded the degree of [73]Doctor of Civil Law honoris
   causa by [74]Pace University.

[[75]edit] Inventions

[[76]edit] Aviation & safe flight instruments

[[77]edit] Stall Warning Device

   During [78]World War II, Greene joined the [79]Grumman Aircraft
   Corporation in [80]Bethpage, NY, as an [81]aerodynamicist and
   [82]engineering test pilot. There he witnessed an aircraft crash caused
   by stall. In aviation, a stall occurs when the airflow over the wings
   is no longer sufficient to provide [83]lift – essentially, a stalled
   wing ceases to function. This happens at low airspeeds or during steep
   climbs. Greene realized that the accident could have been avoided if
   the pilot had been warned of an imminent stall. Aerodynamic stalls
   caused the majority of aviation deaths at the time.

   In the mid-1940s, Greene developed the first practical way to warn the
   pilot of the aerodynamic stall. His first design and apparatus included
   threaded [84]bolts, a [85]bicycle horn and other odd components, all
   powered by [86]flashlight [87]batteries. Greene filed his device for a
   patent in 1944, and the patent was issued in 1949. In order to develop
   his design, Greene founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in
   [88]White Plains, NY, in 1946. There, he refined and marketed the stall
   warning indicator.

   Basically, his device sounded an alert when the plane was in danger of
   not having enough lift to stay flying. This alert would allow time for
   the pilot to take corrective measures. Since its invention, this device
   became standard equipment for all aircraft and has also helped reduce
   the number of accidents due to stalling. The Stall Warning Indicator
   was called “the greatest lifesaver since the invention of the
   [89]parachute”^[14] by the [90]Saturday Evening Post and the device
   received the [91]Flight Safety Foundation’s first Air Safety Award.

[[92]edit] Automatic Throttle System & Wind Shear Warning System

   After developing the Stall Warning Device, Greene continued developing
   aviation inventions. He and his engineering staff at Safe Flight went
   on to conceive devices now commonplace in aircraft, including an
   [93]automatic throttle system in 1956 and a [94]wind-shear warning
   system that warns a pilot if an aircraft enters a dangerous
   [95]microburst and provides escape guidance. He developed the latter in
   the late 1970s after a series of wind-shear-related crashes that
   claimed hundreds of lives.

[[96]edit] Supersonic aircraft

   In his 2001 book Inventorship: The Art of Innovation, Greene described
   finding "creative ideas in the simplest things."^8 To address a key
   problem of supersonic aircraft – window-shattering [97]sonic booms when
   they break the [98]sound barrier – he turned to the [99]earthworm for
   inspiration. Just as an earthworm eats and excretes the earth to move
   past mounds of dirt, he figured a supersonic aircraft's deafening boom
   is caused from its inability to move air out of its way fast enough to
   avoid external [100]shock waves. He patented a device, sold to
   [101]Boeing in 1994, that would use a hollow [102]fuselage and
   strategically placed ducts to suck in, compress, and then release air
   through a plane's tail.

[[103]edit] Outcome

   Today, his firm supplies unique air safety and performance technology
   to virtually every major air carrier, the [104]U.S. Armed Forces, and
   aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Safe Flight products are installed on
   over two-thirds of the world’s aircraft – in the general aviation,
   commercial, and military sectors.

   Safe Flight made Leonard Greene a [105]multimillionaire. He remained
   involved in the business until his death and as recently as 1998
   co-patented and marketed an airborne power line detector and warning
   system for [106]helicopters.

[[107]edit] Non-aviation interests

   While running Safe Flight, Greene received dozens of patents for his
   varied interests; many of them went un-marketed. They included a
   three-dimensional [108]chess game, a device to aid [109]blind painters
   by using musical notes to identify colors, and an instrument of revenge
   against [110]telemarketers who interrupted dinner. When a pitchman
   called, the harassed resident could press a code that alerted the
   marketer that he would be liable for a surcharge for continuing the
   call.

[[111]edit] Policy and charitable work

[[112]edit] Institute for Socioeconomic Studies

   As a successful businessman, Greene implemented innovative employment
   policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the
   differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own
   manufacturing facility

   Seeking a broader forum and greater impact for his ideas, in 1974 he
   founded and financed the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies (ISES), a
   small policy research organization in [113]White Plains, NY, that
   helped advance his ideas on welfare reform, health care, tax reform –
   and after Greene’s son was killed in the [114]September 11 attacks in
   2001 – foreign affairs.

   According to Ostergren, who worked with Green at ISES, “He didn’t
   consider himself a [115]Republican or [116]Democrat, [117]conservative
   or [118]liberal,”^13 but searched for practical solutions to problems
   that intrigued him. He advocated a national tax rebate – $12,000 for
   any family of four, regardless of income, for instance – to alleviate
   poverty.

   Greene criticized the [119]Great Society anti-poverty programs of the
   1960s as ineffective, a waste of taxpayer dollars, and a disincentive
   to work.

   He has also made his mark as a [120]social activist, having designed a
   plan to transform the federal social budget to provide greater income
   security, middle class tax relief, and market incentives for
   productivity growth.

   In pursuit of these interests, Greene was a member of both the Special
   Committee on Welfare & Income Maintenance and the Council on Trends &
   Perspectives of the [121]U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also served as a
   member in the Income Maintenance Committee of the [122]Community
   Service Society and the Work Group on Welfare Reform of the Task Force
   on the [123]New York City Fiscal Crisis.

[[124]edit] Corporate Angel Network

   In 1981, Greene, whose second wife died of cancer, helped start and
   finance [125]Corporate Angel Network (CAN), a [126]charitable
   organization which arranges free transportation on corporate jets for
   [127]cancer patients. This organization has 530 participating
   corporations who generously offer their empty seats to cancer patients.
   CAN flies more than 2,500 cancer patients a year. To date, the
   organization has flown more than 25,000 patients to treatment centers
   nationwide.

   Greene flew the first Corporate Angel Network Flight on December 22,
   1981, when he brought a 16-year old cancer patient home to [128]Detroit
   who had just received treatment in [129]New York City.

[[130]edit] Sailing

   An avid sailor, Greene became a technical adviser to several
   [131]America's Cup races before buying two-time winner [132]Courageous
   from [133]Ted Turner in the early 1980s. Sailing under the aegis of the
   [134]Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, the only undergraduate sailing club
   ever to participate, the Courageous Syndicates 1986 run at the Cup
   spearheaded Greene's campaign to restore the [135]Corinthian ideals of
   amateur sportsmanship to the competition, and more broadly, to team
   sports in general. Despite several of Greene's modifications to the
   [136]keel, the boat's age remained a problem, and his team withdrew
   during the 1986 competition. Following the 1997 donation of Courageous
   to the Museum of Yachting in [137]Newport, RI, the famed 12-meter was
   named Rhode Island's State Yacht.
