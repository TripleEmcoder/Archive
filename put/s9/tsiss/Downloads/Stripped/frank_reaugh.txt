   Notes
   (1) Reaugh considered his art to be an extension of his [17]Christian
   faith by his attempts to capture the beauty of divine Creation.

   (2) As a youth, Reaugh went on [18]cattle drives which awakened his
   interest in nature.

   (3) Many of Reaugh's paintings are located in the [19]Panhandle-Plains
   Historical Museum in [20]Canyon
   (4) Though based in [21]Dallas, Reaugh went on field trips into the
   [22]American Southwest to obtain inspiration for his paintings.

   Charles Franklin Reaugh (December 29, 1860 – May 6, 1945), known as
   Frank Reagh, was an [23]artist, [24]photographer, [25]inventor,
   [26]patron of the arts, and [27]teacher, who was called the "Dean of
   [28]Texas [29]Painters". He devoted his career to the visual
   documentation in [30]pastel and paint, portraying the vast, still
   unsettled regions of the [31]Great Plains and the [32]American
   Southwest. He was active in the [33]Society of Western Artists.^[34][1]

[[42]edit] Early years as budding artist

   Reaugh was born to George Washington Reaugh, a miner in the
   [43]California gold rush, and the former Clarinda Morton
   Spilman^[44][1] near [45]Jacksonville, the seat of [46]Morgan County in
   west central [47]Illinois. Reaugh (pronounced RAY), moved with his
   family in 1876 to [48]Terrell in [49]Kaufman County east of [50]Dallas.
   The original family name was "Castelreaugh", but the [51]Irish family
   shortened it to "Reaugh" when they entered the [52]United States. The
   Reaughs initially made their living in Terrell by planting
   [53]cotton.^[54][2]

   Reaugh developed his skills by copying the works of European masters
   from [55]magazines and from illustrations of larger animals in
   [56]anatomy books. He studied the writings of [57]naturalists [58]Louis
   Agassiz and [59]John Burroughs. In the early 1880s, he was invited by
   the [60]cattlemen brothers Frank and Romie Houston to join them on
   cattle drives near [61]Wichita Falls in [62]Wichita County south of the
   [63]Red River.^[64][1] The Houstons may have also provided financial
   support for Reaugh to further his artistic studies.^[65][3]

   During the winter of 1884-1885, Reaugh studied at the [66]School of
   Fine Arts in [67]St. Louis. From 1888 to 1889 he spent time at the
   [68]Julien School of Art in [69]Paris. Here he became interested in
   pastels at [70]The Louvre [71]museum.^[72][3] Influenced by [73]La Tour
   and realist [74]Anton Mauve, he also studied [75]Flemish and [76]Dutch
   paintings in [77]Belgium and the [78]Netherlands, where he was inspired
   by the work of [79]Paulus Potter.^[80][4]

   In 1890, the Reaughs moved from Terrell to the [81]Oak Cliff section of
   Dallas.^[82][2] There, he and his father built a metal [83]studio
   building in the back yard called "The Iron Shed". Reaugh's works soon
   gained attention and national recognition through art exhibitions,
   including showing at the [84]World's Fairs in [85]Chicago (1893) and
   St. Louis (1904).^[86][3]

[[87]edit] Prolific painter

   Ultimately, Reaugh created more than seven thousand works. He
   concentrated on small [88]plein air pastel sketches of the wild and
   colorful [89]Texas Longhorn, a subject he found challenging to
   illustrate. He once said that "no animal on earth has the beauty of the
   Texas [90]steer."^[91][5] Reaugh recalled that his mother had
   particularly encouraged him in the mastery of painting true-to-life
   forms: "I would sit in the midst of the herds to study their form, the
   workings of their muscles, their character and habits, their
   characteristic spots and markings, and their wonderfully rich and
   varied colors."^[92][5]

   His leading paintings include:

   Watering the Herd (1889)

   The O Roundup (1894)

   Grazing the Herd (1897)

   The Approaching Herd (1902)

   Twenty-Four Hours with the Herd (seven paintings, after 1930)

   'Texas Cattle (April 1933, his last major work)^[93][4]

[[94]edit] Reaugh as inventor

   Reaugh created his own art materials and tools, including a
   [95]patented folding lap [96]easel and compact carrying case for
   pastels. He created and marketed his own brand of pastels, each cast in
   a [97]hexagonal shape to facilitate handling in the field.^[98][3] He
   patented a [99]rotary pump and served on the board of directors for the
   Limacon Pump Company in Dallas.^[100][1]

[[101]edit] Reaugh as art instructor

   Reaugh established an [102]art school in Dallas in 1897. He was a model
   artist and an influential arts educator. For many years, Reaugh led
   groups of art students on sketching expeditions throughout [103]West
   Texas, ranging into [104]New Mexico and [105]Arizona. His colleagues,
   Charles Peter Bock and [106]Louis Oscar Griffith, sometimes accompanied
   him on these trips. Many of his students, including Reveau Bassett,
   [107]Florence McClung, Harry Carnohan, Lucretia Donnell, [108]John
   Douglass, [109]Olin Travis, Edward G. Eisenlohr, Lloyd Goff,
   [110]Alexandre Hogue, and Josephine Oliver, gained regional and
   national prominence. Several of these became part of the group known as
   the [111]Dallas Nine. (Donnell, one of Reaugh's last students, has
   continued her mentor's tradition of taking students on sketching trips.
   ^[112][2]) Reaugh helped found the Dallas Art Society (later the Dallas
   Art Museum), The Frank Reaugh Art Club, and the Striginian Club. Frank
   Reaugh also championed the creation of the [113]Dallas Museum of Art in
   the early twentieth century.

[[114]edit] Legacy

   Reaugh was passionate about his adopted state. Several of his paintings
   are displayed at the [115]Texas State Capitol in [116]Austin. Many of
   his other works are held by the [117]Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
   at [118]West Texas A&M University in [119]Canyon, where he shared the
   spotlight with fellow painter [120]Harold Dow Bugbee, a former
   [121]curator of the museum.^[122][4] Other Reaugh works are at the
   Southwest Collection/Special Library Collection at [123]Texas Tech
   University in [124]Lubbock, and the [125]Harry Ransom Humanities
   Research Center at the [126]University of Texas at Austin.^[127][1]

   In February 1936, the aging Reaugh described his legacy in terms that
   his painting ". . . aside from any artistic merit that they may
   possess, will tell their story, and will be preserved because of
   historical value; for the steer and the cowboy have gone, the range has
   been fenced and plowed, and the beauty of the early days is but a
   memory."^[128][3]

   Reaugh's interest in western art was less on the human side than in the
   animals and the [129]natural environment. In this respect, he was
   unlike [130]Frederic Remington or [131]Charles M. Russell, whose works
   stressed confrontation between man and nature. Reaugh saw the ideal of
   pastoral harmony through the herds that meandered across the
   prairie.^[132][5] Reaugh considered his art a form of [133]Christian
   worship of the [134]Creator.

   With the help of Lucretia Donnell, Reaugh wrote an [135]autobiography
   entitled From Under the [136]Mesquite Tree: An Artist's LIfe on the
   Texas Plains. [137]Historian [138]J. Evetts Haley in 1960 published F.
   Reaugh: Man and Artist.

   In Reaugh’s [139]will, dated May 16, 1940, filed before his death in
   [140]Dallas County, the painter noted, “The main part of my property is
   in pictures… These are largely of the great [141]prairies of Texas and
   the longhorned cattle of fifty years ago . . . It is my wish that these
   pictures be kept together if only for historical reasons. They create
   the spirit of the time. They show the sky unsullied by smoke, and the
   broad opalescent prairies not disfigured by [142]wire fences or other
   signs of man."^[143][5]

   Having given away most of his possessions, Reaugh died in [144]poverty
   in Dallas in 1945 at the age of eighty-four. He had vowed years earlier
   never to live anywhere outside of Texas. He is buried in Terrell
   Cemetery.^[145][1]
