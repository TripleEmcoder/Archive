   Arnold Orville Beckman (April 10, 1900 – May 18, 2004) was an
   [21]American [22]chemist who founded [23]Beckman Instruments based on
   his 1934 invention of the [24]pH meter, a device for measuring acidity.
   He also funded the first [25]silicon [26]transistor company, thus
   giving rise to [27]Silicon Valley.

[[35]edit] Early life

   Beckman was born in [36]Cullom, Illinois, the son of a blacksmith. He
   was curious about the world from an early age. When he was nine,
   Beckman found an old chemistry textbook and began trying out the
   experiments. His father encouraged his scientific interests by letting
   him convert a toolshed into a laboratory.

   [37]World War I was still raging when Beckman turned 18, and so in
   August 1918, he enlisted in the [38]United States Marines. After his
   basic training, he was sent to the [39]Brooklyn Navy Yard, to await
   transit to the war in [40]Europe. Fortunately for him, the war ended in
   November, 1918, and he did not have to fight in [41]France. By another
   stroke of luck, he missed being sent to [42]Russia to fight the
   [43]Bolsheviks by one space in line. Instead, he spent that
   [44]Thanksgiving at the local [45]YMCA, where his table was served by
   17-year-old Mabel Meinzer, who became his wife.

[[46]edit] Education

   Beckman attended the [47]University of Illinois, where he earned his
   [48]bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1922 and his
   [49]master's degree in physical chemistry in 1923. While attending the
   University of Illinois, he was initiated into the [50]Gamma Alpha
   Graduate Scientific Fraternity in December 1922. He joined the
   [51]Delta Upsilon Fraternity.

   Beckman decided to go to Caltech for his doctorate. He stayed there for
   a year, but decided to return to New York and his fianceé, Mabel, who
   was working as a secretary for the [52]Equitable Life Assurance
   Society. He found a job with [53]Western Electric's engineering
   department, the precursor to the [54]Bell Telephone Laboratories.

   At Western Electric, Beckman developed [55]quality control programs for
   the manufacture of [56]vacuum tubes and learned about circuit design.
   It was here that Beckman discovered his interest in [57]electronics.

   Beckman married Mabel on 10 June 1925. The following year, the couple
   moved back to California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He
   became interested in [58]ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his
   doctoral advisor, [59]Roscoe G. Dickinson, on an instrument to find the
   energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light
   onto a [60]thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity,
   which drove a [61]galvanometer. After receiving his doctorate in 1928,
   Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor and then as a
   professor.

   During his time at Caltech, he worked at times with [62]Linus Pauling,
   who had the same doctoral advisor, [63]Roscoe G. Dickinson.

[[64]edit] pH Meter

   Beckman's interest in electronics made him very popular within the
   chemistry department, as he was very skilled in building measuring
   instruments. He also shared his expertise with glass-blowing by
   teaching classes in the machine shop. With the blessing of [65]Robert
   Millikan, Caltech's president, Beckman began accepting outside
   consulting work.

   One of his clients wanted an ink that would not clog. Beckman's
   solution was to make it with [66]butyric acid, a very noxious
   substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to
   manufacture it, so Beckman decided to make it himself. He hired two
   Caltech students to help him, and started the National Inking Appliance
   Company. At first, he tried marketing it as a way to re-ink
   [67]typewriter ribbons, but this approach was not successful.

   Another client, [68]Sunkist, was having problems with its own
   manufacturing process. The lemons that were not salable as produce were
   made into [69]pectin or citric acid, with [70]sulfur dioxide used as a
   preservative. Sunkist needed to know what the acidity of the product
   was at any given time, and the methods then in use, such as [71]litmus
   paper, were not working well.

   Beckman invented the [72]pH meter in 1935. Originally called the
   acidimeter, the pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of
   a solution.

[[73]edit] Transistor

   In 1955, Beckman established the [74]Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory
   to fund [75]William Shockley's research into [76]semiconductor
   technology. Because Shockley's aging mother lived in [77]Palo Alto,
   Shockley established the laboratory in nearby [78]Mountain View,
   California. Thus, [79]Silicon Valley was born.

   During his later years, Beckman lived in [80]Corona del Mar near
   [81]Newport Beach, [82]California. He was an active [83]philanthropist
   through the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation. To date, the
   Foundation has given more than 400 million dollars to various charities
   and organizations. Donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific
   causes as well as his alma maters. He is the namesake of [84]The
   Beckman Institute and the Beckman Quadrangle at the University of
   Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is also the namesake of the Beckman
   Institute, Beckman Auditorium, Beckman Laboratory of Behavioral
   Sciences, and Beckman Laboratory of Chemical Synthesis at the
   California Institute of Technology.

   Beckman and his family also sponsored the creation of the [85]Arnold O.
   Beckman High School in [86]Irvine, California.

   Dr. Beckman's history and the unique Heritage Center is located at the
   Beckman Coulter headquarters in [87]Fullerton, California.

   Mr. Beckman was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall
   of Fame in 1985.^[88][1] In 1987, he was inducted into the [89]National
   Inventors Hall of Fame.^[90][2]
