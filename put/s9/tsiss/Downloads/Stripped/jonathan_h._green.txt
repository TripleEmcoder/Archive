   Other names Jonathan A. Green
   Occupation  Professional gambler, reformer and writer
    Known for  Reformed gambler and later agent for the New York Association
               for the Suppression of Gambling.

   Jonathan Harrington Green (1813-1887) was an American gambler,
   inventor, writer and later reformer in [10]New York City during the
   early-to mid 19th century. In his youth, he was known as one of the
   most skilled [11]card players in the [12]United States. Following his
   retirement from gambling in 1842, he became an active crusader against
   [13]illegal gambling and was responsible for enacting anti-gambling
   laws in several states.

   As an agent for the New York Association for the Suppression of
   Gambling, he conducted an exhaustive report detailing illegal gambling
   operations active in the city in 1850-51. He later toured the country
   as a [14]lecturer and eventually published his [15]memoirs entitled
   Twelve Days in the Tombs (1851), The Gambler's Life (1857) and The
   Reformed Gambler (1858).

[[20]edit] Biography

   Jonathan Green was born in [21]Ohio in 1813. He became an accomplished
   professional gambler as a young man, popularly known from [22]Texas to
   [23]Boston as "Captain Green", and was a regular riverboat gambler on
   the [24]Mississippi River. Among his most noted accomplishments was
   winning $23,000 in one night at the old Chestnut Street Arcade during
   the 1830s. After living in Texas for several years, he suddenly
   abandoned gambling in 1842. Making restitution to those who had lost
   money to him, he traveled the country as a lecturer exposing common
   [25]gambling tricks and spoke out against [26]illegal gambling for the
   next nine years. His popularity as "the Reformed Gambler" gained a
   significant following and helped pass anti-gambling laws in several
   states. He also wrote several books on the subject including "Green on
   Gambling", Gambling Unmasked (1844), An Exposure of the Arts and
   Miseries of Gambling (1845), The Secret Band of Brothers (1848),
   Gambling in Its Infancy and Progress (1849) and An Exposition of Games
   and Tricks with Cards (1850). ^[27][1]

   Green became a general executive agent of the New York Association for
   the Suppression of Gambling and, between 1850-51, he conducted an
   exhaustive investigation on illegal gambling operations in New York
   City. On February 20, 1851, he presented his findings at the Brooklyn
   Tabernacle reporting the existence of an estimated 6,000 gambling
   houses, 200 of these being high-class establishments "catering to men
   of standing and sound financial substance", as well as several thousand
   raffling, lottery and policy houses. Green was one of several prominent
   speakers, most notably [28]Horace Greeley, who addressed the large
   crowd. ^[29][2] He continued writing and published his memoirs Twelve
   Days in the Tombs (1851), The Gambler's Life (1857) and The Reformed
   Gambler (1858). Green returned to Indiana at the start of the
   [30]American Civil War and became a captain in the [31]Union Army and
   was later employed by the [32]US Secret Service. An amateur inventor,
   he took out 20 to 30 patents although his inventions proved far more
   profitable to others than to himself. ^[33][1]

   He moved to [34]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876 and lived a private
   retired life. He eventually became destitute in his old age and,
   following his wife's death in 1884, a public appeal was made when he
   was unable to pay for his wife's funeral. ^[35][1] Donations from
   "[36]kindly minded friends" were sufficient enough to allow Green to
   bury his wife. ^[37][3] Green himself died three years later.
