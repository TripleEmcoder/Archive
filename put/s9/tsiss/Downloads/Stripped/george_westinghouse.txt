   Signature

   George Westinghouse, Jr (October 6, 1846 – March 12, 1914) was an
   [11]American [12]entrepreneur and [13]engineer who invented the
   [14]railway air brake and was a pioneer of the electrical industry.
   Westinghouse was one of [15]Thomas Edison's main rivals in the early
   implementation of the American electricity system. Westinghouse's
   system, which used [16]alternating current based on the extensive
   research by [17]Nikola Tesla, ultimately prevailed over Edison's
   insistence on [18]direct current. In 1911, he received the [19]AIEE's
   [20]Edison Medal "For meritorious achievement in connection with the
   development of the alternating current system."

   Mr. Westinghouse was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business
   Hall of Fame in 1980.

[[30]edit] Early years

   Westinghouse was born in Central Bridge, NY in 1846. He was the son of
   a machine shop owner and was talented at machinery and business. He was
   only 19 years old when he created his first invention, the [31]rotary
   steam engine.^[32][1] He also devised the [33]Westinghouse Farm Engine.
   At age 21 he invented a "car replacer", a device to guide derailed
   railroad cars back onto the tracks, and a [34]reversible frog, a device
   used with a railroad switch to guide trains onto one of two
   tracks.^[35][1]^[36][2]

   At about this time he witnessed a train wreck where two engineers saw
   one another, but were unable to stop their trains in time using the
   existing brakes. Brakemen ran from car to car, on catwalks atop the
   cars, applying the brakes manually on each car.
   Westinghouse Steam and Air Brakes ([37]U.S. Patent 144,006)

   In 1869 at age 22 he invented a railroad braking system using
   compressed air. The Westinghouse system used a compressor on the
   locomotive, a reservoir and a special valve on each car, and a single
   pipe running the length of the train (with flexible connections) which
   both refilled the reservoirs and controlled the brakes, applying and
   releasing the brakes on all cars simultaneously. It is a failsafe
   system, in that any rupture or disconnection in the train pipe will
   apply the brakes throughout the train. It was patented by Westinghouse
   on March 5, 1872. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) was
   subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's
   invention. It was in time nearly universally adopted. Modern trains use
   brakes in various forms based on this design.

   Westinghouse pursued many improvements in [38]railway signals (then
   using oil lamps) and in 1881 he founded the [39]Union Switch and Signal
   Company to manufacture his signaling and switching inventions.

[[40]edit] Electricity and the "War of Currents"

   Main article: [41]War of Currents

   In 1879 Edison invented an improved [42]incandescent light bulb, and
   realized the need for an electrical distribution system to provide
   power for lighting. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on the
   world's first electrical power distribution system, providing 110
   [43]volts [44]direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower
   [45]Manhattan, around his [46]Pearl Street laboratory.

   Westinghouse's interests in gas distribution and telephone switching
   logically led him to become interested in electrical power
   distribution. He investigated Edison's scheme, but decided that it was
   too inefficient to be scaled up to a large size. Edison's power network
   was based on low-voltage DC, which meant large currents and serious
   power losses. [47]Nikola Tesla was working on "[48]alternating current
   (AC)" power distribution. An AC power system allowed voltages to be
   "stepped up" by a [49]transformer for distribution, reducing power
   losses, and then "stepped down" by a transformer for consumer use.

   A power transformer developed by [50]Lucien Gaulard of [51]France and
   [52]John Dixon Gibbs of [53]England was demonstrated in [54]London in
   1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. Transformers were not
   new, but the Gaulard-Gibbs design was one of the first that could
   handle large amounts of power and was easily manufactured. In 1885
   Westinghouse imported a number of Gaulard-Gibbs transformers and a
   [55]Siemens AC [56]generator to begin experimenting with AC networks in
   [57]Pittsburgh.
   Westinghouse Early AC System 1887 ([58]U.S. Patent 373,035)

   Assisted by [59]William Stanley, and [60]Franklin Leonard Pope,
   Westinghouse worked to refine the transformer design and build a
   practical AC power network. In 1886 Westinghouse and Stanley installed
   the first multiple-voltage AC power system in [61]Great Barrington,
   Massachusetts. The network was driven by a [62]hydropower generator
   that produced 500 volts AC. The voltage was stepped up to 3,000 volts
   for transmission, and then stepped back down to 100 volts to power
   electric lights. That same year, Westinghouse formed the
   "[63]Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company", which was renamed
   the "Westinghouse Electric Corporation" in 1889.

   Thirty more AC lighting systems were installed within a year, but the
   scheme was limited by the lack of an effective metering system and an
   AC [64]electric motor. In 1888, Westinghouse and his engineer
   [65]Oliver B. Shallenberger developed a power meter, with a design that
   mimicked a gas meter. The same basic meter technology remains in use
   today. An AC motor was a more difficult task, but a design was already
   available as [66]Nikola Tesla had already devised the principles of a
   [67]polyphase electric motor. Tesla had conceived the [68]rotating
   magnetic field principle in 1882 and used it to invent the first
   brushless AC motor or [69]induction motor in 1883, but was employed by
   Thomas Edison since 1884.

   However, by 1886, Tesla and Edison had abruptly parted ways in what
   would become a well-publicized quarrel, at which point Westinghouse was
   able to contact Tesla and obtain [70]patent rights to his AC motor.
   Westinghouse hired him as a consultant for a year and from 1888 onwards
   the wide scale introduction of the polyphase AC motor began. The work
   led to the modern US power-distribution scheme: three-phase AC at 60
   Hz, chosen as a rate high enough to minimize light flickering, but low
   enough to reduce reactive losses, an arrangement also conceived by
   Tesla.

   Westinghouse's promotion of AC power distribution led him into a bitter
   confrontation with Edison and his DC power system. The feud became
   known as the "[71]War of Currents". Edison claimed that high voltage
   systems were inherently dangerous. Westinghouse replied that the risks
   could be managed and were outweighed by the benefits. Edison tried to
   have legislation enacted in several states to limit power transmission
   voltages to 800 volts, but failed.

   The battle went to an absurd level when, in 1887, a board appointed by
   the state of New York consulted Edison on the best way to execute
   condemned prisoners. At first, Edison wanted nothing to do with the
   matter.
   Probably the most famous American electric chair—Old Sparky from
   [72]Sing-Sing Prison.

   Westinghouse AC networks were clearly winning the battle of the
   currents, and the ultra-competitive Edison saw a last opportunity to
   defeat his rival. Edison hired an outside engineer named [73]Harold P.
   Brown, who could pretend to be impartial, to perform public
   demonstrations in which animals were electrocuted by AC power. Edison
   then told the state board that AC was so deadly that it would kill
   instantly, making it the ideal method of execution. His prestige was so
   great that his recommendation was adopted.

   Harold Brown then sold gear for performing electric executions to the
   state for $8,000. In August 1890, a convict named [74]William Kemmler
   became the first person to be executed by electrocution. Westinghouse
   hired the best lawyer of the day to defend Kemmler and condemned
   electrocution as a form of "cruel and unusual punishment". Of the first
   17 seconds that the current flowed, meant to kill the man, he survived.
   People were horrified and scrambled to turn the current back on,
   although no one is quite sure how long the second burst lasted. A
   reporter got a hold of Westinghouse in Pittsburgh and asked about the
   execution. "I do not care to talk about it. It has been a brutal
   affair. They could have done better with an axe."^[75][3] The
   [76]electric chair became a common form of execution for decades,
   although it had been proven to be unsatisfactory for the task. However,
   Edison failed to coin the term "Westinghoused" for what happened to
   those sentenced to death.

   Edison also failed to discredit AC power, whose advantages outweighed
   its hazards. Westinghouse was able to build pivotal projects using AC
   power such as the [77]Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant in 1891 and
   the original Niagara Falls [78]Adams Power Plant in 1895 which proved
   to be a success. Even [79]General Electric, which absorbed Edison
   General Electric in 1892, decided to begin production of AC equipment.

   In 1889, Westinghouse hired [80]Benjamin G. Lamme (1864–1924)
   electrical engineer and inventor. Interested in mechanics and
   mathematics from childhood, Lamme graduated from [81]Ohio State
   University with an engineering degree (1888). Soon after joining
   Westinghouse Corp, he became the company's chief designer of electrical
   machinery. His sister and fellow Ohio State graduate, Bertha Lamme
   (1869–1943), the nation's first woman electrical engineer, joined him
   in his pioneering work at Westinghouse until her marriage to fellow
   Westinghouse engineer, Russel Feicht. Among the electrical generating
   projects attributed to Bertha Lamme is the turbogenerator at
   [82]Niagara Falls. The [83]New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway
   adopted the Lamme's single-phase [84]overhead electrification system in
   1905. Benjamin Garver Lamme was Westinghouse's chief engineer from 1903
   until his death.

   In 1893, in a significant victory, the Westinghouse company was awarded
   the contract to set up an AC network to power the [86]World's Columbian
   Exposition in [87]Chicago, giving the company and the technology
   widespread positive publicity. Westinghouse also received a contract to
   set up the first long-range power network, with AC generators at
   [88]Niagara Falls producing electricity for distribution in
   [89]Buffalo, New York, 40 kilometers (25 miles) away.

   With AC networks expanding, Westinghouse turned his attention to
   electrical power production. At the outset, the available generating
   sources were hydroturbines where falling water was available, and
   reciprocating [90]steam engines where it was not. Westinghouse felt
   that reciprocating steam engines were clumsy and inefficient, and
   wanted to develop some class of "rotating" engine that would be more
   elegant and efficient.

   One of his first inventions had been a rotary steam engine, but it had
   proven impractical. British engineer [91]Charles Algernon Parsons began
   experimenting with [92]steam turbines in 1884, beginning with a 10
   horsepower (7.5 kW) unit. Westinghouse bought rights to the Parsons
   turbine in 1885, and improved the Parsons technology and increased its
   scale.

   In 1898 Westinghouse demonstrated a 300 kilowatt unit, replacing
   reciprocating engines in his air-brake factory. The next year he
   installed a 1.5 megawatt, 1,200 rpm unit for the [94]Hartford Electric
   Light Company.

   Westinghouse then developed steam turbines for maritime propulsion.
   Large turbines were most efficient at about 3,000 rpm, while an
   efficient propeller operated at about 100 rpm. That required reduction
   gearing, but building reduction gearing that could operate at high rpm
   and at high power was difficult, since a slight misalignment would
   shake the power train to pieces. Westinghouse and his engineers devised
   an automatic alignment system that made turbine power practical for
   large vessels.

   Westinghouse remained productive and inventive almost all his life.
   Like Edison, he had a practical and experimental streak. At one time,
   Westinghouse began to work on [95]heat pumps that could provide heating
   and cooling, and believed that he might be able to extract enough power
   in the process for the system to run itself.

   Any modern engineer would clearly see that Westinghouse was after a
   [96]perpetual motion machine, and the British physicist [97]Lord
   Kelvin, one of Westinghouse's correspondents, told him that he would be
   violating the laws of [98]thermodynamics. Westinghouse replied that
   might be the case, but it made no difference. If he couldn't build a
   perpetual-motion machine, he would still have a heat pump system that
   he could patent and sell.

   With the introduction of the [99]automobile after the turn of the
   century, Westinghouse went back to earlier inventions and devised a
   compressed air [100]shock absorber for automobile suspensions.

   Westinghouse remained a captain of American industry until 1907, when a
   financial panic led to his resignation from control of the Westinghouse
   company. By 1911, he was no longer active in business, and his health
   was in decline.

   George Westinghouse married Marguerite Erskine Walker on August 8,
   1867. They had one child, George Westinghouse 3rd, and were married for
   47 years. George Westinghouse died on March 12, 1914, in New York City,
   at age 67. As a Civil War veteran, he was buried in [102]Arlington
   National Cemetery, along with his wife Marguerite, who survived him by
   three months. Although a shrewd and determined businessman,
   Westinghouse was a conscientious employer and wanted to make fair deals
   with his business associates.

   In 1918 his former home was razed and the land given to the City of
   Pittsburgh to establish [103]Westinghouse Park. In 1930, a memorial to
   Westinghouse, funded by his employees, was placed in [104]Schenley Park
   in Pittsburgh. Also named in his honor, [105]George Westinghouse Bridge
   is near the site of his Turtle Creek plant. Its plaque reads:

          IN BOLDNESS OF CONCEPTION, IN GREATNESS
          AND IN USEFULNESS TO MANKIND THIS BRIDGE
