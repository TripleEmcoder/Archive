[[16]edit] Biography

   Skene was born in [17]Fyvie, [18]Scotland on June 17, 1837. At the age
   of 19, he went to America. He studied medicine at King's College (now
   the [19]University of Toronto), then at the [20]University of Michigan,
   and finally at the [21]Long Island College Hospital (now the [22]State
   University of New York Downstate Medical Center) in [23]Brooklyn
   graduating in 1863. From July 1863 until June 1864, he was acting
   assistant surgeon in the [24]U. S. Army, after which he entered private
   practice in Brooklyn and advanced to become Professor of Disease of
   Women at Long Island College Hospital. He was professor of gynecology
   in the Post-graduate Medical School of New York in 1884, and was
   president of the [25]American Gynecological Society.

   Skene wrote over 100 medical articles and several textbooks. He
   contributed many surgical instruments and improved on surgical
   techniques. He performed the first successful operation of
   gastro-elytrotomy that is recorded, and also that of craniotomy, using
   Sims's speculum. Primarily, he is remembered for his description of the
   [26]Skene's glands at the floor of the [27]urethra. He also described
   their infection - skenitis.

   As a sculptor, Skene created a bust of [28]J. Marion Sims, which is on
   display in the lobby of the Kings County Medical Society. A bust
   honoring him is located in [29]Prospect Park Plaza (also known as
   [30]Grand Army Plaza).

   Skene died in his summerhouse in the [31]Catskills, New York on July 4,
   1900. He left behind a son, Jonathan Bowers.
