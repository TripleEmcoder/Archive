        Born      20 November 1848(1848-11-20)
                  [7]Plain Township^[[8]disambiguation needed], [9]Pennsylvania
        Died      22 January 1915(1915-01-22) (aged 66)
                  [10]Chicago, Illinois
     Residence    [11]Canton, Ohio
    Nationality   [12]United States
     Known for    Invention of the portable electric vacuum cleaner
   Notable awards [13]National Inventors Hall of Fame (2006)

   James Murray Spangler (November 20, 1848 – January 22, 1915) was an
   American inventor, salesman and janitor who invented the first
   commercially successful portable electric vacuum cleaner that
   revolutionized household carpet cleaning. His device was not the first
   vacuum cleaner. However, Spangler’s device was the first that was
   practical for home use. It was the first to use both a cloth filter bag
   and cleaning attachments. Spangler improved this basic model and
   received a patent for it in 1908. He formed the Electric Suction
   Sweeper Company to manufacture his device. [14]William H. Hoover was so
   impressed with the vacuum cleaner that he bought into Spangler's
   business and patents.

[[22]edit] Early Years and Personal Life

   James Murray Spangler was one of ten children born to Mr. William
   Spangler & Mrs. Elizabeth Lind Spangler on November 20, 1848. The
   Spangler family was originally from [23]Plain
   Township^[[24]disambiguation needed], Pennsylvania and settled in
   [25]Stark County, Ohio.

   On May 21, 1874, Spangler married Elista (Lettie) Amanda Holtz. They
   had three children, Clarence, Francis and Jennie. In 1880 they moved to
   Akron.

[[26]edit] Career

   After moving to Akron, Spangler was in business with his brother
   selling gent's furnishings. He also worked for the Aultman Company as a
   salesman.

   James Murray Spangler was granted a patent on a grain harvester in
   1887. He invented certain new and useful improvements such as the
   sliding tailboard made of sheet metal. He removed a standard tailboard
   and provided the sliding tailboard to regulate the width of the
   platform and adjust it to grain of different length. He also installed
   guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller.

   James Murray Spangler invented a combined [27]hay rake and [28]tedder
   which was patented in 1893. By his peculiar arrangement, he was able to
   provide a combined hay rake and tedder in one machine, thereby reducing
   the cost. He formed a company for its sale which was unsuccessful and
   short-lived.

   In 1897 he was granted a patent for a [29]velocipede wagon and sold his
   invention to a company in Springfield, Ohio. He claimed as new “the
   combination of the body or box, mounted upon traveling wheels”.^[30][1]
   The bicycle became quite popular at the same time and interfered with
   the sale of the wagon.

   He later worked as a sweeper at the Zollinger Dept. Store located in
   the Folwell Bldg. located on the northwest corner of the public square
   in Canton, Ohio. (The top floor was occupied – in 1907 - by the Elks
   Club and the remaining floors occupied by the Wm. R. Zollinger Dept.
   Store.)

[[31]edit] Invention of the portable electric vacuum cleaner

   James Spangler was an asthmatic. Almost 60 and cursed with strong
   disease, he grew frustrated at the tedious and dusty work of sweeping
   the carpet in the store where he worked . He deduced that the carpet
   sweeper he used on the job was the source of his cough. A tinkerer at
   heart, he set his mind to making an electric carpet sweeper.

   While watching a rotary street sweeper in operation, Spangler got the
   idea to mount the motor from a sewing machine onto a carpet sweeper and
   cut a hole in the back of the sweeper to attach fan blades which would
   blow dirt out of the rear of the cleaner into an attached dirt bag (a
   pillow case he borrowed from his wife). He attached a leather belt from
   the motor shaft to the wood cylinder brush roll and a broom stick
   supplied the handle. In his next attempt he used a wooden soap box as
   the main body. He used his invention successfully in cleaning the
   Folwell Bldg. Bringing his ingenuity to bear on the problem, Spangler
   fashioned a tin box, a pillowcase, an electric fan, and a broom handle
   into something we might recognize today as a crude vacuum cleaner.
   Spangler called it a "suction sweeper."

   Despite being primitive and unwieldy, it worked—Spangler's asthma
   abated, and he received a patent for his troubles. He also realized
   that he might finally have a salable invention. Spangler first tested
   his invention in 1907. During the next year, he refined the vacuum
   numerous times, and on June 2, 1908, he received a patent for his
   sweeper.

   Spangler, with $5,000.00 invested by a friend, formed the Electric
   Suction Sweeper Company. Ray Harned, nephew and financial
   representative of F.G. and W.H. Folwell, formed partnership with
   Spangler in the fall of 1907. The Folwells had financed Zollingers and
   were financing Spangler who had filed an application for a patent in
   September 1907. However, in just a few months, finances were gone.
   Spangler didn't have the capital to mass-produce his gadget. So he
   showed the suction sweeper to his cousin Susan Hoover, who tried it,
   liked it, and extolled its virtues to her husband, [32]William Hoover,
   a leather-goods manufacturer.

   The timing was fortuitous: With the automobile gaining popularity,
   William Hoover was concerned about the market for his horse collars and
   harnesses, and was eager to diversify. In 1908 he bought Spangler's
   patent, and he soon had a small staff toiling in the corner of his
   leather shop, turning out six suction sweepers a day. William Hoover
   made further improvements to the vacuum cleaner that resembled a
   bagpipe attached to a cake box. A novel look that was very functional.
   Sluggish sales of the Hoover vacuum cleaner were given a kick by
   Hoover’s ten day, free home trial. Hoover came up with the idea of
   door-to-door salesmen who gave home demonstrations of the new vacuum
   cleaners Hoover's success means that most people today associate the
   vacuum cleaner with him, rather than with Spangler.

[[33]edit] Later years

   After Spangler sold the patents to William Hoover, he stayed on with
   the Hoover Company as the superintendent. Spangler's wife and daughter
   (Jennie Spangler Painter) made all the bags for the sweepers until 1914
   when the bag making was taken to New Berlin. Clarence, Spangler's son,
   worked about a year for The Electric Suction Sweeper Co. in New Berlin.
   He became very ill and died in December 1911.

   Spangler was planning the first vacation of his life, a trip to
   Florida. He died the night before he was to leave. It was Jan. 22,
   1915. He was 66 years old. Spangler's family continued to receive
   royalties until his patent expired June 2, 1925.
