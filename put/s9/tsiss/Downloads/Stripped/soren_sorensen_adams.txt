[[15]edit] Biography

   He was born Søren Adam Sørensen near [16]Aarhus, [17]Denmark in 1879 to
   Hans and Sofia Sørensen, and migrated to the US with his family at age
   four, and grew up in [18]Perth Amboy, [19]New Jersey where his father
   operated a saloon. In 1904 Adams found himself employed as a salesman
   for a dye company. One of the products he sold caused workers to
   sneeze, and Sam found a way to extract this derivative from the dye and
   called this new powder Cachoo. He was inundated by requests for this
   product from his friends and so, he decided to sell his interest in a
   hotel in [20]York, [21]Pennsylvania, and used the money to launch the
   Cachoo Sneezing Powder Company in [22]Plainfield, [23]New Jersey.

   Within a few years, the sneezing powder craze that swept the country
   had subsided, and Sam set out to innovating new products. He also
   changed the name of the company to S.S. Adams Co. to reflect that he
   was no longer a one product company. The Exploding Cigarette Box , the
   [24]Snake Nut Can, Itching Powder, the [25]Stink bomb, and the
   [26]Dribble glass all entered the Adams line in the next decade.

   In 1928, Sam invented the prototype of what was to become the [27]Joy
   Buzzer, a mechanical device placed in the hand, which emitted a loud
   vibrating buzz, when a button on the buzzer was depressed. This would
   usually occur when two people shook hands. He took the prototype to
   [28]Dresden, [29]Germany, where a tool and die maker created the
   tooling to make small parts for the item, which was now just 3.2cm
   (1-1/4 inches) in diameter and 1.8cm (3/4 inch) thick. The final item
   was patented in 1932. The success of the item allowed him to greatly
   increase his staff and purchase a stately new factory building in
   [30]Neptune, New Jersey, all during the [31]Great Depression.

   Sam and S.S. Adams went on to create many more successful novelties:
   The Bar Bug in Ice Cube, The Money Maker, The Squirting Nickel, The
   Jumping Coin, Laughing Tissue as well as an extensive line of magic
   tricks and puzzles. He claimed to have devised over 600 different
   items, and patented about 40 of them. He continued to lead S.S. Adams
   Company until his death in [32]Asbury Park, NJ in 1963 at age
   84.^[33][1]
