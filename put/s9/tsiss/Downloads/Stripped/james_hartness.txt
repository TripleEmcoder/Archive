[[32]edit] Biographical

   Hartness was born in [33]Schenectady, New York, one of three sons. His
   family moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1863 where his father was a foreman
   in local machine shops and Hartness attended public school. Hartness
   worked up through the ranks in machine shops in Connecticut before
   moving to [34]Springfield, Vermont, where he had a brilliant career as
   an innovator of machine tools. He became one of the nation’s first
   aviators and became a one-term governor of the state of Vermont. He had
   two daughters, Anna and Helen. His daughter, Helen ([35]Helen Hartness
   Flanders), was a noted [36]folk song collector who married [37]Ralph
   Flanders, a [38]U.S. Senator from [39]Vermont^[40][1] Hartness died in
   Springfield in 1934. He is buried in the Summer Hill Cemetery in
   Springfield, not far from his mansion. The Hartness mansion is now (as
   of 2007) the "Hartness House", a bed-and-breakfast hotel and
   restaurant.

[[41]edit] Engineering innovation and entrepreneurship

   At age 16, Hartness began his career in machine shops. At age 21 he
   became a foreman at the Winsted-Norway Bolt Company in [42]Winsted,
   Connecticut. He moved in 1886 to [43]Torrington, Connecticut to work as
   a [44]tool-maker and foreman at the Union Hardware Company. His
   lifetime achievement of more than 100 patents began here with patents
   of locks, roller skates, and bicycle pedal mechanisms.

   Hartness had an unpleasant experience at Union Hardware: he had been
   understandably naive about arranging for royalties on his patents, and
   the business owners chose not to help rectify the oversight. He did not
   get to share in the profits derived from the patents. In September
   1888, after he had lost several weeks' work to illness, Union Hardware
   told him not to return.^[45][2]

   During the winter of 1888-1889, he worked briefly for several
   companies: [46]Pratt & Whitney in [47]Hartford, Connecticut; Eaton,
   Cole and Burnham Co. in [48]Bridgeport, Connecticut, and a plant in
   [49]Scottdale, Pennsylvania.^[50][1]^[51][2] Roe (1937) surmised that
   sometime during 1888 or a little before, the idea of the
   [52]flat-turret lathe had developed in his mind; and that his
   peregrinations in the winter of 1888-1889 were in search of a suitable
   company at which to build it.^[53][2]
   Hartness 3x36 flat turret lathe with cross sliding head, equipped for
   bar work.^[54][3]

   In April 1889 he moved to [55]Springfield, Vermont to become the
   superintendent at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J&L) Machine
   Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he
   found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased
   efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the
   burgeoning automobile industry.^[56][1]^[57][4]^[58][5] The flat turret
   lathe improved upon earlier turret lathes via greater rigidity,
   allowing higher precision, higher [59]speeds and feeds, and longer
   cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to
   complement the lathe, including improved roller bar feed and [60]die
   head designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made
   faster, and thus less expensively, which made the lathe highly
   desirable to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend
   his interest in his patent. He arranged with J&L to receive a $100
   royalty on each machine.

   Hartness changed J&L’s business model from making a wide variety of
   machines to order to specializing in the manufacturing and improving of
   this one product. With rapid acceptance of this machine tool, orders
   reached 10 units per day from the manufacturing sector. As a result,
   Hartness reportedly received up to $1,000 per day in royalties.^[61][6]
   He also introduced appealing and informative catalogues to market the
   new Jones and Lamson products. Hartness acquired a large interest in
   J&L. He became manager in 1896 and president in 1901 until his
   retirement in 1933.^[62][4]

   "You will hear from that young man again, and from this 'Lazy Susan' of
   his."
   — [63]Ambrose Swasey, on James Hartness, after Hartness had
   unsuccessfully shopped his flat-turret idea around with several machine
   tool builders, including [64]Warner & Swasey. Swasey was the only one
   who predicted success for the idea.^[65][2]

   lathe, ca. 1920. Jones & Lamson publicity photo.

   In 1915 Hartness reluctantly decided to engage in “war business,”
   heeding his brother John’s pleas from the London office of J&L. During
   [66]World War I Hartness, as a representative of [67]American Society
   of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), became Chairman of the National
   Screw-Thread Commission, the mission of which was to create
   international standards for the measurement and sizing of [68]screw
   threads.

   Hartness discouraged modernizing of the Hartness Flat Turret Lathe.
   Nevertheless, it remained a very successful product until after
   Hartness's retirement, when a new J&L turret lathe model by John Lovely
   finally replaced it.^[69][4]

   Hartness’s interest in the measurement and standardization led to his
   invention of an optical device that allowed the profile of small parts
   to be illuminated and compared with their desired outline.
   Traditionally, mechanics used a mechanical gauge to assess whether
   screws were to specifications. Hartness employed his knowledge of
   optics and magnification to devise a much more practical optical method
   for measurement.^[70][6] The Hartness Screw-Thread Comparator was his
   crowning achievement in the profitability of J&L.^[71][4] Today
   [72]optical comparators are a common form of equipment in many machine
   shops.

   The 1921 edition of the ASME mechanical catalog and directory^[73][7]
   showed that J&L offered several models of Hartness flat turret lathe,
   an automatic chucking lathe, an automatic die, a screw-thread
   comparator, and the [74]Fay automatic lathe. J&L had offices in
   Springfield, Vermont, [75]San Francisco, [76]California, and
   [77]London, [78]England, plus agents in five other countries.^[79][7]

[[80]edit] Mentor of machine tool entrepreneurs

   stock.^[81][3]

   Hartness encouraged talented inventors in his employ at J&L to strike
   out on their own as [82]entrepreneurs. These included three Springfield
   companies and one Windsor, Vermont company:
     * [83]Edwin R. Fellows, founder of the Fellows Gear Shaper Company
     * William L. Bryant, founder of the [84]Bryant Chucking Grinder
       Company
     * Fred P. Lovejoy, founder of the Lovejoy Tool Company
     * George O. Gridley, founder of the National Acme Company

   The companies started by these men helped make Springfield and Windsor
   a prosperous manufacturing region, thanks not to its access to raw
   materials or markets, but due to a pool of talented engineers and
   machinists. Joseph Roe ranked Hartness in the class of [85]Henry
   Maudslay and [86]Elisha K. Root for his mentorship of a younger
   generation of machine tool builders.^[87][8]

[[88]edit] Encouragement of smarter management with better relationship to
workers

   His son-in-law, Ralph Flanders, reported that Hartness examined “some
   of the elements which go into making workmen both contented and
   productive” in his book The Human Factor in Works Management.^[89][4]
   His Hartness Turret Lathe Manual starts with the statement:
   “ Since the machine is only an implement, it cannot be considered a
     thing entirely apart from the man. In fact, the man is the greater
     part. The personal welfare of the operator must be considered. This is
     something more than the man’s relation to the machine. It includes an
     equally important phase—his relationship to other men and to his
     environment in general.^[90][3]                                        ”

   In a sense Hartness was responding to the era's enthusiastic fervor for
   [91]scientific management, which Hartness and many others felt did not
   adequately address the psychology of how to manage employees as human
   beings and maintain their respect.

[[92]edit] Affiliations, degrees, and medals

   Hartness was an active member of the following engineering, scientific,
   and arts societies:
     * [93]American Society of Mechanical Engineers, which elected him
       [94]president in Fall 1913 to serve the 1914–1915 term
       ^[95][9]^[96][10]
     * American Engineering Council (formerly the Federated American
       Engineering Societies), which elected him president in 1924 to
       serve the following two-year term^[97][10]
     * [98]Society of Automotive Engineers^[99][11]
     * British [100]Institution of Mechanical Engineers^[101][11]
     * [102]American Association for the Advancement of Science
       (Fellow)^[103][11]
     * British [104]Royal Aeronautical Society (Fellow)
     * [105]American Astronomical Society (Member)^[106][11]
     * British [107]Royal Astronomical Society (Member)^[108][11]
     * British Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts
       (Member)^[109][11]
     * [110]Aero Club of America
     * Aero Club of Vermont

   His life achievements were recognized with honorary degrees from the
   University of Vermont (ME in 1910^[111][11] and LLD in 1920^[112][11])
   and Yale University (MA in 1914).^[113][10]^[114][11] The [115]Franklin
   Institute awarded Hartness the [116]Edward Longstreth Medal^[117][11]
   in 1921, recognizing his contributions to mechanical
   engineering.^[118][1] In the same year the [119]American Philosophical
   Society and the City Trusts of Philadelphia^[120][11] awarded the John
   Scott Medal to Hartness for the flat turret lathe, citing its
   usefulness in making artillery.^[121][12]

[[122]edit] Aviation

   Hartness first flew in Germany in 1913 in a hydrogen-filled
   [123]airship, designed by [124]Ferdinand von Zeppelin. In 1914,
   Hartness learned to fly a 35 horsepower (26 kW) [125]Wright Flyer near
   [126]Garden City, New York. He obtained his pilot's license from the
   [127]Aero Club of America.^[128][13] He encouraged, and served as
   president of, the Vermont Aero Club. He donated the land for the
   Springfield Aerodrome to the state, establishing the first airfield in
   Vermont, now known as "Hartness State Airport".

   After his trans-Atlantic flight, Charles Lindbergh toured the United
   States in the Spirit of St. Louis to promote aviation. He landed in
   Springfield on July 26, 1927 in his visit to Vermont and spoke at a
   large gathering at the airport. Hartness hosted Lindbergh at his
   home.^[129][6]

[[130]edit] Astronomy

   Hartness’s interest in [131]optics and [132]astronomy led to his
   development of a [133]telescope mount with the revolving dome on an
   [134]equatorial plane. An additional feature of this telescope, which
   still stands at the former Hartness Mansion, was that the optics of the
   telescope passed through a lens in the wall of the dome. This allowed
   the observer to stay warm in winter. (Conventional telescopes were
   often contained within domes that opened an aperture for the telescope
   to gain exposure both to the sky and the ambient air.) The success of
   this patent led to more telescope activities and commissions.^[135][6]
   With Hartness's encouragement and financial support, [136]Russell W.
   Porter initiated the Springfield Telescope Makers Club. The club still
   celebrates their annual [137]Stellafane gathering in
   Springfield.^[138][14]

[[139]edit] Governor of Vermont

   Hartness was a one-term governor of Vermont from 1921 to 1923. He
   campaigned on the issue of enticing Vermonters to stay in state rather
   than seek employment elsewhere.^[140][1] He also promised an improved
   transportation system and more manufacturing to supplement the
   traditional agricultural economy. He won the election by a wider margin
   in the state than Warren Harding, who carried Vermont in the
   presidential race that year.^[141][6]
