   Elwood P. Haynes (October 14, 1857 – April 12, 1925) was an
   [30]American inventor, [31]metallurgist, automotive pioneer,
   entrepreneur and [32]industrialist. He invented the metal alloys
   [33]stellite and [34]martensitic [35]stainless steel and designed one
   of the earliest automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized
   for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for
   [36]mass production and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the
   first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably.
   He made many advances in the automotive industry.

   Early in his career, while serving as a superintendent at gas and oil
   companies during [37]Indiana's [38]gas boom, Haynes invented several
   devices important to the advance of the [39]natural gas industry. When
   working for the Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, he oversaw the
   construction of the first long-distance natural gas pipeline in the
   United States, connecting [40]Chicago with the [41]Trenton Gas Field
   150 miles (240 km) away. He began to formulate plans for a motorized
   vehicle in the early 1890s; he successfully road tested his first car,
   the Pioneer, on [42]July 4, 1894—eight years after the first automobile
   was patented in Germany. He formed a partnership with Elmer and Edgar
   Apperson in 1896 to start [43]Haynes-Apperson for the commercial
   production of automobiles, and he renamed it [44]Haynes Automobile
   Company in 1905, following the loss of his partners.

   Working in his auto company's laboratory to develop new
   [45]corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that
   mixing [46]tungsten with [47]chromium, [48]steel and [49]iron resulted
   in the formation of strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious
   to corrosion and could withstand very high temperatures. He formed
   [50]Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys and
   received lucrative contracts during [51]World War I, making Haynes a
   millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the
   American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a
   seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for twelve
   years. Because of labor problems, he sold the stellite company and
   patent to [52]Union Carbide in 1920, and after passing through
   different owners, the company was renamed and is now called [53]Haynes
   International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but
   in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went [54]bankrupt
   and was [55]liquidated. He lost a quarter of his fortune in 1925 when
   he was held personally responsible for a large portion of the company's
   debts.

   An outspoken advocate of [56]prohibition, he made substantial donations
   to the [57]Prohibition Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader
   [58]Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in [59]Indiana for
   the [60]U.S. Senate in [61]1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained
   active in the party until prohibition became law. Later, he became a
   philanthropist and served two terms as president of the [62]YMCA, five
   years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was an active member of
   the [63]Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising
   from [64]influenza, his [65]Kokomo mansion was converted into the
   [66]Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public where many of his
   original inventions and automobiles are on display.

[[85]edit] Early life

[[86]edit] Family and background

   Haynes was born on October 14, 1857, in [87]Portland, Indiana, the
   fifth of ten children of Jacob M. Haynes and Hilinda S. Haines Haynes.
   His family was of [88]English descent; his ancestors had immigrated to
   [89]New England in 1638. His father was [90]Jay County's school
   commissioner, a lawyer, [91]Whig politician, and a judge of the Jay and
   [92]Randolph County common pleas court.^[93][1] Both of Haynes' parents
   were dedicated [94]Presbyterians and outspoken [95]prohibitionists and
   educated their children from a young age to avoid liquor. His mother
   was the founder of a local Women's Temperance Movement Union.^[96][2]
   His paternal grandfather Henry Haynes was a [97]gunsmith and mechanic,
   and tutored Haynes about [98]metallurgy.^[99][3] In 1866, the family
   moved from their two-room house in Portland into the countryside
   outside of town where they purchased a larger home to better
   accommodate their growing number of children.^[100][1]^[101][4]

   At age 12, Haynes built his first vehicle from scrap railroad car parts
   and operated it on the county's railroad tracks. The local railroad
   foreman did not approve and later seized the vehicle and destroyed
   it.^[102][5]^[103][6] As a child, Haynes had an interest in
   [104]chemistry and [105]metallurgy and when he was 15, with his
   grandfather's help, he built a smelting furnace and began working with
   [106]copper, [107]bronze, and [108]iron.^[109][7] Haynes was also
   interested in nature and spent considerable time in the forest
   cataloging and observing plants, insects, and animals. Because he spent
   so much time there, his family nicknamed him "Wood", a nickname they
   used for most of his life.^[110][2] As he grew older, he became an avid
   reader of books, including Principles of Natural Philosophy and
   Chemistry by William Wells.^[111][5] His early experiments and studies
   interested him in the [112]fundamental properties of matter, and he was
   intrigued by how mixing compounds could create completely different
   alloys.^[113][7]^[114][8]

[[115]edit] Education

   Haynes' [116]Francis Murphy Temperance pledge card

   Haynes attended public schools through [117]eighth grade and received a
   basic education. He had not determined a career path for himself and
   his parents often criticized him for lacking ambition; they insisted
   that he seek employment. He began by working as a [118]custodian at a
   local church and later for the railroad, hauling [119]ballast to
   construction sites. At the church, he joined the choir where he met and
   began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high
   school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and
   completed two more years.^[120][9] Bertha and her family moved to
   [121]Alabama during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular
   correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of
   [122]revival meetings were held in Indiana by [123]Francis Murphy, a
   leader of a national [124]temperance organization known as the Murphy
   Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents urging,
   and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge
   cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to
   Bertha.^[125][9]

   Haynes' father attended the [126]Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in
   1876 where he learned of a school that would fit his son's interests.
   Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and
   enrolled in the [127]Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial
   Science in [128]Worcester, Massachusetts, in September
   1878.^[129][5]^[130][10] The school was revolutionary for its time,
   combining technical training with a classical [131]liberal arts
   education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he
   found that he was ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he
   struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he
   worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He
   cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books
   and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were
   increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he
   lived in the library for several months.^[132][6]^[133][11] He could
   not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during
   the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in [134]New
   England.^[135][12]
   Boynton Hall at [136]Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial
   Science

   During his first term, he was required to receive a grade of 60 to
   remain in the school. Although he only achieved a 59.2 after completing
   his final exams, he was permitted to remain because of his "recent
   progress."^[137][13] Older than the other students in his class, he
   often spoke out against their use of alcohol.^[138][11] In his final
   year he took courses in metallurgy, [139]ore analysis and
   [140]assaying, and participated in a research project developing
   razors. His graduation thesis was entitled "The effects of Tungsten on
   Iron and Steel". It laid out the basic principles of what would later
   become his two greatest advances in metallurgy. Haynes spent many hours
   in the institute's laboratory working with [141]tungsten and other
   metals before graduating in 1881; he was fourteenth out of twenty-one
   graduates—twenty did not pass.^[142][14]^[143][15]

   Haynes took a job teaching at the Jay County public school after
   returning home.^[144][16] Soon his income allowed him to buy a home
   near Portland High School where he worked and was promoted to principal
   in 1882. That summer he took a week-long trip to visit Bertha in
   [145]Chattanooga, [146]Tennessee, where he became sick with a cold and
   spent most of his time in bed nursed by Bertha, learning that her
   family would be returning to live in Portland in 1883.^[147][17] After
   returning from the trip, he continued saving money and in 1884 he
   decided to continue his education by enrolling at [148]Johns Hopkins
   University in [149]Baltimore, Maryland. He chose the school because, as
   it was only eight years old, it had one of the most modern laboratories
   available. He took courses in chemistry and [150]biology and learned
   advanced metallurgic techniques.^[151][18] His mother died in May 1885
   and he decided to leave the university without completing his second
   year, as he was not working to attain a degree but only taking courses
   of interest. After he had returned home again, he took a position at
   the newly established Eastern Indiana Normal School and Commercial
   College (now [152]Ball State University) and served as the head of the
   chemistry department.^[153][7]^[154][19]^[155][20]

[[156]edit] Gas boom

   See also: [157]Indiana Gas Boom

   [158]Natural gas was first found in Indiana in 1876 but it was not
   until 1886 that the magnitude of the discovery was known; the
   [159]Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas
   discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in
   the United States.^[160][21] As a professor at a university in the
   Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked
   to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on
   the amount of energy that could be created by the gas.^[161][22] He
   delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the
   gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of
   fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a
   corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes
   and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas
   and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new
   company's board of directors.^[162][19]^[163][23]

   In the fall of 1886, the board hired Haynes as superintendent to manage
   the company and oversee the creation of wells and piping. The company
   was one of the first in the Trenton Field, and many of the others which
   soon followed modeled themselves on the Portland company. As a fuel and
   industry, natural gas was in its earliest stages. Haynes invented
   several devices that became important to the success of the industry.
   One of his first inventions was a device capable of measuring the
   amount of gas being pumped from wells.^[164][7]^[165][24] Haynes'
   reputation as an industry leader grew out of his operations at Portland
   and the Kokomo Democrat referred to him as "the only infallible
   authority on natural gas in eastern Indiana" in a 1889
   article.^[166][25]

   Haynes married Bertha Lanterman in October 1887 after a ten-year
   relationship. The ceremony was held at her parents' Portland home and
   the couple honeymooned in [167]Cincinnati. Their first child, Marie,
   was born on January 28, 1889, but she soon succumbed to illness and
   died when six months old. Their second child, a son born in 1890, also
   died in infancy. The deaths saddened the family and caused them to turn
   more to their religion. Haynes became increasingly active in the
   Presbyterian church and became an [168]elder. In December 1892, the
   Haynes' third child, Bernice, was born. A second son, March, was born
   1896. The two children were well educated and grew up to assist their
   father in his enterprises.^[169][24]

   A primary pipeline was laid between Portland and a neighboring town
   during 1889. Haynes oversaw construction of the ten-mile (16 km) long
   pipeline and the creation of the wells for pumping the gas. During his
   numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive
   of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic
   were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their
   inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently
   traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more
   economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially
   move at a faster rate of speed.^[170][26]^[171][27]^[172][28]

   The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, headquartered in [173]Chicago,
   hired Haynes as their field superintendent in 1890 after the company's
   board of directors "discovered that Elwood Haynes knew more about
   natural gas than anyone in the state".^[174][29] He and his wife moved
   to [175]Greentown where he oversaw the construction of the company's
   first pumping wells. The company planned to construct a natural gas
   line from eastern Indiana to Chicago, a distance of over 150 miles (240
   km), which would be the first long-distance natural gas pipeline built
   in the United States. Haynes supervised the design and construction
   phases of the project.^[176][24] Because of the length of the line and
   the temperature changes between the two points, moisture in the natural
   gas [177]condensed on the pipe, and during colder times would freeze
   the pipes in some locations. The problem was a significant setback to
   the operation, which had to stop pumping during the winter months.
   Haynes solved the problem by creating a refrigeration device that would
   cause the moisture (which was a diluted form of [178]gasoline) to
   condense, freeze, and fall into a reservoir. These devices were
   installed between the main lines and pumping stations and effectively
   removed all the moisture from the natural gas before it was pumped into
   the lines.^[179][24]^[180][30] This prevented water buildup in the
   pipes and allowed the pipes to be used year round. The concept was a
   significant advance in early [181]refrigeration technology and was
   further developed by others in later years.^[182][26]

   Haynes was offered a higher ranking position within Indiana Gas at the
   Chicago headquarters, but by then he had become aware of the business's
   connection to the corrupt and disgraced [183]monopolist [184]Charles T.
   Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any
   corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice
   to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and
   instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago
   leadership.^[185][31] After the pipeline became fully operational in
   1892, Haynes moved to [186]Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the
   Indiana Gas's local operations. The [187]Indiana General Assembly began
   attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations
   of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary
   target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports
   and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed
   to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas
   be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the
   flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was
   flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source
   of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($240,000
   in 2009 [188]chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a
   figure that shocked the company's leaders.^[189][32] Despite his
   support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly
   against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity.
   He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after
   their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate
   artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until
   1896, when the [190]Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations
   were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed,
   including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among
   other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905—modern
   experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet
   (30 km^3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or
   misused.^[191][33]

[[192]edit] Enterprises

[[193]edit] 1894 First Haynes car

   According to Haynes, he began laying out "plans for the construction of
   a mechanically propelled vehicle for use on highways" in
   1891.^[194][26] His first idea was for a steam powered vehicle, but
   after careful consideration he decided the use of a furnace on the
   device would be too dangerous. His second plan was to use electrical
   power, but after research he found that no practical means existed to
   store the electricity required for operation. He continued to develop
   his plans until the summer of 1893 when he attended the [195]Chicago
   World's Fair, where he first witnessed a [196]gasoline engine. The
   demonstration of the newly invented engine inspired him to decide that
   an [197]internal combustion engine would be the most practical method
   to propel his vehicle.^[198][24]^[199][26]^[200][27] A gasoline powered
   European automobile built by [201]German inventor [202]Karl Benz (who
   patented the first automobile in 1886) also was on display during the
   fair, although it is unknown if Haynes witnessed this vehicle during
   his visit.^[203][34]

   Haynes ordered a one-[204]horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine
   from Stintz Gas Engine Company in [205]Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225.
   Although the engine was intended for use on a small boat, Haynes
   believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The 180-lb (82-kg)
   engine arrived in the fall of 1893 and was accompanied by Harry Kraft.
   Kraft was a Stintz company engineer who was interested in Haynes' use
   of the engine and offered valuable advice for adapting the motor for
   Haynes' project.^[206][24] Haynes soon had the device attached to a
   carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine
   that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and
   before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the
   carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with
   smoke.^[207][27]^[208][35]

   Haynes decided he needed a different facility to continue the
   experiment after his wife told him she would not abide his destruction
   of the family kitchen.^[209][36] He contacted Elmer Apperson, the
   operator of the Riverside Machine Shop, and arranged to use a space in
   his shop for the continued development. He agreed to work on his
   vehicle only after-hours, pay 40 cents per hour for the help of Elmer
   and his brother Edgar, and to not hold them responsible should his
   project fail. He started building a new carriage, this time with a
   heavier metal harness made of steel.^[210][35] He described the
   appearance of the vehicle as a "small truck".^[211][26] The wheel axles
   were also made of steel and the entire front axle was constructed to
   swivel. A central column was built of steel and laid across the axles
   in such a way as to allow it move in all directions within a small
   radius to accommodate any sudden movements by the motor or
   vehicle.^[212][37]^[213][38]
   Elwood Haynes driving in his first automobile, the 1894 Pioneer, photo
   taken c. 1910

   Because the traction of rubber tires was unknown, Haynes completed a
   series of tests with a bicycle on paved roads. He used a wagon built to
   the weight of his automobile and a horse to pull a device that would
   cause the wheels to turn, thereby providing traction. With this, he was
   able to determine the ratio of weight to gear sizes needed to enable
   the tires to provide sufficient traction for propulsion. Once
   completed, his vehicle weighed about 820 pounds (370
   kg).^[214][35]^[215][37]

   He named his car the Pioneer and first test drove the vehicle on
   [216]July 4, 1894. The Apperson brothers had notified the Kokomo
   townspeople of the test drive and a crowd gathered to witness the
   event. Haynes was concerned that his vehicle could injure someone in
   the crowd, so he had the vehicle towed by a horse and buggy to a state
   turnpike, away from the crowd. The car started with Haynes driving and
   Elmer Apperson riding as a passenger, and traveled at 7 mph (11 km/h).
   He traveled for 1.5 miles (2.4 km) and then stopped the vehicle to
   manually turn it around with Elmer's help. He proceeded to drive it
   several more miles back into town without stopping. His trip convinced
   him that the vehicle was worthwhile and could become a valuable
   enterprise, although he was disappointed in the vehicle's handling and
   decided he needed to improve the steering system and find a way to
   divert the motor's exhaust smoke away from the
   carriage.^[217][35]^[218][37]

   Haynes' car is believed to be the second gasoline-engine powered
   vehicle to be successfully road tested in the United States, according
   to its exhibit information at the [219]Smithsonian
   Institution.^[220][39] It was built two years before [221]Henry Ford's
   [222]Quadricycle, and preceded only by [223]Charles Duryea's Motorized
   Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an
   adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power
   but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to
   run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to
   determine that Haynes' car was the first true American
   automobile.^[224][36]^[225][40] The Stintz company continued to be
   intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to
   photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one
   of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of
   numerous other automobiles across the American [226]midwest.^[227][41]

   Haynes continued to drive his car as he added improvements to the
   vehicle, and constructed the Pioneer II in 1895 to incorporate his
   improved steering designs and an exhaust pipe.^[228][30] He built the
   new car with the intention of running it the [229]1895 Chicago
   Times-Herald Race, the first automobile race in the United States.
   Although over seventy-five cars were entered in the race, most of their
   owners did not have them completed in time for race so only three cars
   and six early motorcycles showed up.^[230][42] While driving to the
   race, Haynes had a confrontation with a Chicago policeman who insisted
   that Haynes had no right to drive his vehicle on public roads, forcing
   him to requisition a horse to pull the car the rest of the way. Similar
   incidents happened with the other race's entries so the city passed an
   ordinance a few days later to clear up any ambiguity in the laws and
   allow automobiles equal access to the city streets, allowing the
   postponed race to take place. While giving his car a ride around the
   town on the following day Haynes was involved in what is believed to be
   the first automobile accident after swerving to miss a street car and
   striking a sharp curb, busting a tire and damaging the axle.^[231][43]
   Without a spare tire, Haynes was unable to run in the race. The race
   was held on November 28, and thousands of spectators turned out.
   Duryea's car won first place and a German Benz came in second. Another
   contest was held in which Haynes won a prize for most intuitive
   design.^[232][43]

[[233]edit] Haynes-Apperson

   Main article: [234]Haynes-Apperson

   Haynes continued to perfect his auto design, and in late 1895 he began
   his work to create a new hard alloy for use as a [235]crankcase and
   other auto parts. His intent was to make a metal that would be
   resistant to rusting. He experimented with the use of aluminum and
   found that when used, it significantly deadened the noise produced by
   the engine parts. As his designs progressed, he decided to form a
   partnership for the manufacture of his vehicles. At the end of 1894,
   Haynes joined with Elmer and Edgar Apperson to create an automobile
   company and began producing cars that year. Their company is recognized
   as being the first viable automotive company in the United States, and
   the second company to commercially produce autos.^[236][44]^[237][45]
   The [238]Duryea Motor Wagon Company had formed a year earlier, but went
   out of business after producing only thirteen vehicles.^[239][40]
   Haynes became involved in a dispute with the Duryea company over the
   advertisements Haynes-Apperson ran, claiming to have created the first
   automobile. The Haynes-Apperson advertisement was clearly false, but
   after Duryea's company went bankrupt in 1898, there was no one to
   continue to dispute the claim. "America's First Car" remained the
   company's motto for the rest of its existence.^[240][46]

   By 1896, the company had the infrastructure to produce one new car
   every two to three weeks and was building vehicles on order for $2,000.
   As the number of orders increased, the company was formally
   incorporated as [241]Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in
   capital obtained by issuing stock to Portland and Kokomo businessmen.
   At the end of that year the company was relocated to a large factory it
   had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce was
   expanded as production increased. Advertisements were run in area
   newspapers and Haynes-Apperson cars were demonstrated at county fairs
   and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five
   cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in
   1901.^[242][47] The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two
   shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory
   running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that
   year.^[243][30]^[244][45]
   A 1903 Haynes-Apperson car advertisement

   Haynes-Apperson automobiles were known for their long-distance running
   capability. The company's cars regularly competed and won prizes in
   endurance races that demonstrated the distance and terrain over which
   the cars could travel. Haynes had soon designed superior methods of
   achieving traction and his car could climb hills easier than his
   competitors in the early races.^[245][48] The last model designed under
   the Haynes-Apperson name had three speeds and was capable of 24 mph on
   pneumatic tires.^[246][45] In 1901, a Haynes car was entered in the
   first Long Island Non-Stop endurance race. The Haynes car took first
   place in the race, adding to the company's publicity and helped feed a
   large jump in sales.^[247][49]

   Another event to gain the company significant publicity was the sale of
   a car to Dr. Ashley A. Webber in New York City. Webber refused to buy
   any car unless the seller could prove the car's endurance by driving it
   to his home. Haynes and Edgar Apperson readily agreed to the demand and
   drove the car from Kokomo to Webber's New York home, the first time an
   automobile traveled over 1,000 miles (1,600 km).^[248][50] The trip
   took over a month; after driving several days in the rain, the two
   decided to install a roof on future models.^[249][50]

   Haynes began to have disagreements with the Apperson brothers for
   reasons that were never made public but were probably over money and
   design plans. Haynes wanted to produce luxury cars because much of the
   company's early clientele was wealthy, while the Appersons wanted to
   produce utilitarian vehicles that could be marketed to
   businesses.^[250][51] The disagreement led the two brothers to split
   from Haynes and start a company of their own in 1902. The loss of his
   partners necessitated that Haynes leave his position at Indiana Gas to
   devote more time to his growing business.^[251][45] Haynes was most
   interested in working on development, and turned over daily management
   to Victor Minich in 1903. Haynes spent most of his research efforts on
   developing metals in an attempt to discover lighter and stronger alloys
   for use in automobile parts. He also investigated other areas and
   published a 1906 paper on the impurities in gasoline and recommended
   that the sulfur content in the fuel be lowered to increase engine
   performance.^[252][52]

[[253]edit] Haynes Automobile Company

   Main article: [254]Haynes Automobile Company

   In 1905, three years after the [255]Apperson brothers split from
   Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the [256]Haynes Automobile Company
   and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000
   cars was organized in [257]New York City during 1908 and Haynes, whom
   many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the
   parade down Broadway riding in the Pioneer.^[258][53] He was followed
   by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display the advancement
   in technology. On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the
   city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too
   fast—in a car with a top speed of 15 mph (17 km/h)—and taken to jail.
   He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning
   that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade.^[259][53]
   The celebration was intended to be a ten year commemoration of the
   invention of the automobile, although earlier self-vehicles dated back
   nearly twenty years in [260]Europe. Haynes donated the Pioneer to the
   United States Government in 1910 to be placed in the [261]Smithsonian
   Institution where it is still on display in the [262]National Museum of
   American History as the second oldest motorized vehicle in the United
   States.^[263][39]
   A 1919 [264]Haynes Automobile Company advertisement

   Haynes' Model L was his most popular vehicle. First designed in 1905,
   the three-speed car could travel at 35 mph (58 km/h) and carry four
   passengers; the company sold over 4,300. Haynes expanded the company
   significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever-increasing sales. More stock
   was issued and more capital raised to build a new and larger factory.
   By 1909 the company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced
   between $2,500 and $5,500. In 1910, Haynes Auto became the first
   company to build a car with a roof, windshield, headlights, and a
   speedometer as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of
   producing the best luxury vehicles.^[265][54]

   More than 1,000 autos were built by Haynes Automobile Company in 1910
   and the company continued to experience growth, until a devastating
   fire swept the company factory in 1911 and killed one employee.
   Recovery from the blaze was slow, and it was not until 1913 that the
   company was able to resume its growth.^[266][52] To continue the
   promotion of his cars, Haynes organized a trip in which he crossed the
   country by automobile in 1914. The trip gained considerable attention
   from the press and gave his company publicity and a much needed sales
   boost in the wake of the fire. Almost every town he visited printed
   newspaper stories on his invention and many hailed him as the "Father
   of the Automobile".^[267][11]

[[268]edit] Haynes Stellite Company

   Haynes continued his research into ways to produce [269]corrosion
   resistant metals.^[270][45] While working on alloys for use in
   [271]spark plugs, he created a metal he named [272]stellite. Realizing
   the value of his discovery, he patented his first version in 1907. The
   metal was very resistant to corrosion and had immediate application in
   tool making and numerous other implementations. He continued to
   experiment with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper
   to the [273]International Congress of Applied Chemistry and the
   [274]American Institute of Metals, where he held memberships.^[275][52]
   His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June
   20.^[276][55]

   He applied for another patent on an alloy he called [277]stainless
   steel, now known as martensitic stainless steel. The government
   rejected his application saying that it was not a new alloy. Haynes
   conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a
   sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his
   exact proportions of metals, and it was granted.^[278][56]^[279][57] At
   the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel
   silverware for her personal use. In later years he claimed to have
   created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their
   silver tableware.^[280][30] British metallurgist [281]Harry Brearley
   independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and
   applied for an American patent and found that one already existed.
   Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they
   were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out
   Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company
   to produce the alloy.^[282][58] Haynes sold his stainless steel patent
   in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had
   created with the assistance of investors in [283]Pennsylvania. In
   exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until
   the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed
   him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he
   installed his son, March, to represent him.^[284][59] The income from
   the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large
   fortune.^[285][45]^[286][60]

   Seeing stellite as a far more valuable metal, he decided to keep its
   patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to
   produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for
   the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the
   best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough
   of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several
   companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy
   and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did
   not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form, but to
   only sell it as specific finished products. In that way, he remained
   the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal.^[287][61] As
   [288]World War I broke out, his company received large government
   contracts for use of the material. Stellite was found to have excellent
   applications in airplanes, and because it was non-corrosive and could
   protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal
   available for ammunition casing. In 1916 alone, the company registered
   $1.3 million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes
   increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that
   year.^[289][45]^[290][62] Despite his large income, he refused to
   provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in
   the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their
   wages were not raised, he told him, "It doesn't pay to give the working
   man too much money—it makes him too independent." His statement was
   widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it
   alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor
   problems.^[291][59]

   After the war, Haynes Stellite moved to producing tableware, jewelry,
   and pocket knives. The employees of the company unionized and began to
   demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat
   of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to
   sell the company to [292]Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange
   for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2 million. He later
   made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the
   deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much
   $4 million on the sale.^[293][59] After a series of owners, the company
   is now called [294]Haynes International and is again
   independent.^[295][62]

[[296]edit] Later life

[[297]edit] Prohibition

   Elwood Haynes, c. 1919

   Haynes was an avid supporter of prohibition and spoke several times on
   behalf of prohibitionist leader [298]Frank Hanly, lending him both
   personal and financial support. Hanly advocated the passage of a local
   option law that allowed most of Indiana to ban liquor sales in 1909. He
   continued in his support of the [299]Prohibition Party and donated it
   thousands of dollars and an automobile nicknamed the "Prohibition
   Flyer". He became increasingly involved in the organization and [300]in
   1916 he ran for the [301]United States Senate on the prohibition
   ticket, making many speeches and stumping across the state. He was
   overwhelmingly defeated, receiving only 15,598 votes out of nearly one
   million cast.^[302][63] [303]Harry Stewart New, the [304]Republican
   candidate narrowly won the election by plurality, and Haynes was
   accused of costing Incumbent Democratic Senator [305]John W. Kern's
   re-election. Despite his personal electoral failure, liquor sales were
   completely banned in Indiana by a 1918 law that went into effect in
   1919. With his goals achieved, Haynes switched to join the Republican
   Party, but was significantly less active in politics
   thereafter.^[306][11]

   Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was a critic of the
   [307]Indiana Branch of the [308]Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height
   of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and
   fellow prohibitionists, he ridiculed the organization for using violent
   and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of
   hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democrat
   politicians.^[309][64] Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during
   that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the
   organization.^[310][65]

[[311]edit] Philanthropy

   Haynes purchased a new home on Webster Street in Kokomo in 1916. The
   home, known as the Elwood Mansion, was large enough to house a personal
   laboratory for Haynes to work in.^[312][66] As he grew older and became
   less involved in his businesses, Haynes became increasingly
   philanthropic. He made regular large donations to the Presbyterian
   church and became a patron of the Worcester Institute he had attended,
   providing scholarships and donating funds for expansion.^[313][59]

   He funded the formation of a [314]Young Men's Christian Association in
   Kokomo where he and his son became active. Haynes taught swimming
   classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys to movies and
   bought them dinners. After several years of active membership at the
   local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and
   served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the
   launching of several successful membership drives. In 1920, he was
   appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by [315]Governor
   [316]James P. Goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for
   vocational education.^[317][59]^[318][67]

   The United States economy went into a recession in the early 1920s and
   automobile sales decreased. Coupled with increasing competition, Haynes
   Automobile Company began running into debt problems. Haynes had to use
   his personal savings to rescue the company in 1921 and pay off some
   outstanding accounts. A bond drive was launched to raise $1 million to
   help fund the company through the period, but it fell significantly
   short of raising enough money. Haynes was the primary purchaser of the
   bonds. Unlike the other large auto companies like Ford and General
   Motors, Haynes Auto did not have the widespread dealership agreements
   that were able to sustain their companies through the hard times.
   Haynes Auto sales quickly began to slip from a peak of nearly 6,000
   cars sold in 1922. In 1923 sales dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 in
   1924.^[319][68] The situation continued to be bleak for the company,
   and it was forced to declare bankruptcy in October 1924.^[320][69]
   Haynes sought a merger with multiple other auto companies, including
   [321]Henry Ford, but partners were not forthcoming and Haynes was
   forced to agree to a liquidation in 1925. He was held personally
   responsible for about $95,000 of the company's debt.^[322][70] In
   addition, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the company and a
   substantial amount in investment bonds. In total, the loss cost Haynes
   an estimated quarter of his net worth.^[323][71]

[[324]edit] Death and legacy

   On January 6, 1925, Haynes, the Apperson brothers, and other automotive
   pioneers were awarded gold medals by the National Automobile Chamber of
   Commerce at a New York City auto exhibition for their contributions to
   the industry.^[325][72] On his return trip home, he contracted
   [326]influenza and his health began to deteriorate rapidly. In March,
   he asked his son to take over his business interests while he traveled
   to [327]Florida to seek rest in the warmer climate. His condition
   steadily worsened, causing him to cancel his planned trip to [328]Cuba
   and return to Kokomo. He remained in his home, attended by two personal
   physicians until his death from [329]congestive heart failure on April
   13, 1925.^[330][71] Haynes' funeral was held in Kokomo before his
   interment at the city's Memorial Park cemetery.^[331][73]

   Haynes' fortune had shrunk considerably with the collapse of his auto
   company. He still held an estimated $2.85 million^[332][74]
   ($35 million in 2009 [333]chained dollars) in stocks, bonds, and other
   assets, but almost all of his cash savings were gone. He had already
   been forced to borrow money using future dividends and royalties as
   collateral, leaving his family with some difficulty in coming up with
   funds to maintain his home.^[334][75] Haynes' estate was left to his
   wife who continued to live in the family mansion until her own death
   from a stroke in August 1933. The family assets were distributed
   between Bernice and March who separately oversaw their portion of the
   family's interests. March inherited the family mansion, but sold it to
   the [335]General Motors Company who used it as a company headquarters
   and a laboratory for several years. The company sold the mansion in
   1965 to Bernice, who donated it to the city of Kokomo. The city
   converted it into the [336]Elwood Haynes Museum and it has been open to
   the public since 1967.^[337][76] In January 1944 the SS Elwood Haynes,
   a [338]Liberty Ship built during [339]World War II, was named in
   Haynes' honor.^[340][73]^[341][77]

   Haynes is remembered as a pioneer of the American automobile, and as
   the creator of the first automobile design viable for mass
   production.^[342][46] He is credited as being one of those primarily
   responsible for the rapid growth of the natural gas industry in
   Indiana, a boom that made northern Indiana one of the leading
   industrial regions of the United States. He is also remembered for his
   development of stainless steel and stellite, materials that are
   commonly used across the world today. Stellite remains an important
   metal, as its ability to withstand high temperatures has made it a
   component in American spacecraft.^[343][30]^[344][73]
