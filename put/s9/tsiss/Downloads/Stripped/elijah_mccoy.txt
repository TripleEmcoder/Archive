   Elijah J. McCoy (May 2, 1844^[13][2] – October 10, 1929) was an
   [14]African Canadian [15]inventor and engineer, known for his many
   [16]U.S. [17]patents.

[[24]edit] Professional life

   After studying engineering in [25]Edinburgh, [26]Scotland, and
   returning home to [27]Canada, he found work as a fireman and oiler at
   the [28]Michigan Central Railroad. In a home-based machine shop in
   Ypsilanti, Michigan, McCoy invented an automatic lubricator for oiling
   the [29]steam engines of [30]locomotives and boats. For this he
   obtained his first patent, "Improvement in Lubricators for
   Steam-Engines" ([31]U.S. Patent 129,843), on July 12, 1872.

   Similar automatic oilers had been patented previously; one is the
   [32]displacement lubricator which had already attained widespread use
   and whose technological descendants continued to be widely used into
   the 20th century. Lubricators were a boon for [33]railroads, allowing
   trains to run faster and more profitably with less need to stop for
   lubrication and maintenance.^[34][3]

   McCoy continued to refine his devices and design new ones, and after
   the turn of the century attracted notice among his [35]African-American
   contemporaries. [36]Booker T. Washington in Story of the Negro (1909)
   recognized him as having produced more patents than any other black
   inventor up to that time. This output ultimately propelled McCoy to a
   heroic status in the African American community which has persisted to
   this day. He continued to invent until late in life, obtaining as many
   as 57 patents mostly related to lubrication, but also including a
   folding [37]ironing board and a lawn sprinkler. Lacking the capital
   with which to manufacture his lubricators in large numbers, he usually
   assigned his patent rights to his employers or sold them to investors.
   Lubricators with the McCoy name were not manufactured until 1920, near
   the end of his career, when he formed the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing
   Company.^[38][3]

   There is no consensus regarding the importance of McCoy's contribution
   to the field of lubrication. At one extreme, he is credited in some
   biographical sketches with revolutionizing the railroad or machine
   industries with his devices. At the same time, he is scarcely mentioned
   in the old [39]lubrication literature; for example, his name is absent
   in [40]E. L. Ahrons' Lubrication of Locomotives (1922) which does refer
   to several other early pioneers and companies of the field.

   The saying [41]the real McCoy, meaning the real thing, has in some
   cases been erroneously accredited to Elijah's invention. The theory is
   that railroad engineers looking to avoid inferior copies would inquire
   if a locomotive was fitted with "the real McCoy".^[42][4] The original
   publication of this claim can be traced to a 1985 pamphlet printed by
   the Empak Publishing Company, who could not explain how they developed
   the theory.^[43][5] Other earlier origins to the phrase are unanimously
   accepted by the writing community and by [44]lexicographers.^[45][4]

[[46]edit] Personal life

   McCoy married Ann Elizabeth Stewart in 1868; she died four years later.
   He remarried the next year to Mary Eleanor Delaney and moved to
   [47]Detroit. Mary McCoy was one of the founders of the [48]Phillis
   Wheatley Home for Aged Colored Men in 1898.^[49][6]

   Elijah McCoy died in Detroit in 1929 at the age of 86, still suffering
   from injuries from a car accident seven years earlier that killed his
   second wife. McCoy had been a resident of the [50]Eloise Hospital, a
   [51]Sanatorium, also known as the [52]Michigan State Asylum (now in
   [53]Westland, Michigan), before his death, suffering from
   [54]dementia.^[55][7]

[[56]edit] Legacy

   In 1975, Detroit celebrated Elijah McCoy Day, as officials placed a
   historic marker at the site of his home. The city also named a street
   for him.^[57][8]

   In 2001, he was inducted into the [58]National Inventors Hall of Fame
   in Akron, Ohio.^[59][9]

   In 2006, Canadian playwright Andrew Moodie wrote a play called The Real
   McCoy which chronicles the life of Elijah, his inventions and his
   personal tragedies until his death.

   He is commemorated in other Michigan historical markers. One is at his
   home, 5720 Lincoln Avenue, Detroit, Michigan at the intersection of
   Elijah McCoy Drive. Michigan Registry of Historic Sites: P25170.
   Listed: November 14, 1974 in front of the Elijah McCoy Homes. The other
   is at his first workshop, in [60]Ypsilanti, Michigan Registered Site
   S0642 which was erected in 1994.^[61][10]

   His remains are interred at Detroit Memorial Park East in [62]Warren,
   Michigan.^[63][11] This fact is noted on a Michigan Historical
   Marker.^[64][12]
