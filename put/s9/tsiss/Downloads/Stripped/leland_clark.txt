                    Leland C. Clark Jr.
       Born      December 4, 1918(1918-12-04)
                 [7]Rochester, New York, [8]United States
       Died      September 25, 2005(2005-09-25) (aged 86)
   [9]Alma mater [10]Antioch College
                 [11]University of Rochester
     Known for   Inventor of the Clark oxygen electrode

   Leland C. Clark Jr. (1918–2005) was an American biochemist born in
   Rochester, New York.^[12][1] He is most well-known as the inventor of
   the [13]Clark electrode, a device used for measuring oxygen in blood,
   water and other liquids.^[14][2] Clark is considered the "Father of
   [15]Biosensors", and the modern-day glucose sensor used daily by
   millions of diabetics is based on his research. He conducted pioneering
   research on heart-lung machines in the 1940s and '50s and was holder of
   more than 25 patents. Although he developed a fluorocarbon-based liquid
   that could be breathed successfully by mice in place of air, his
   lifelong goal of developing artificial blood remained unfulfilled at
   the time of his death. He is the inventor of [16]Oxycyte, a
   third-generation perfluorocarbon (PFC) therapeutic oxygen carrier
   designed to enhance oxygen delivery to damaged tissues.^[17][3]

[[24]edit] Professional life

   Clark received his B.S. degree in Chemistry from [25]Antioch College in
   1941 and his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Physiology from the
   [26]University of Rochester in 1944. Clark began his professional
   career as an Assistant Professor of biochemistry at his alma mater,
   Antioch College, in Yellow Springs, Ohio. When he left Antioch in 1958,
   he was head of the department. From 1955 to 1958, he held a
   simultaneous appointment the University of Cincinnati College of
   Medicine as a Senior Research Associate in Pediatrics and Surgery. In
   1958, Clark moved to Alabama to join the Department of Surgery,
   University of Alabama Medical College as an associate professor of
   biochemistry. He later became professor of biochemistry in the same
   department. Clark became professor of research pediatrics at the
   Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation in 1968 and remained
   there until he retired in 1991. Afterwards, he helped to found the
   company Synthetic Blood International, now known as Oxygen
   Biotherapeutics, Inc., which markets his invention [27]Oxycyte.

   Other Clark inventions were put into production and marketed by Yellow
   Springs Instrument Company company.^[28][4]

   He was a founding member of the Editorial Board of the scientific
   journal Biosensors & Bioelectronics in 1985.

[[29]edit] Personal life

   Clark was known as "Lee" to his friends. He met Eleanor Wyckoff while
   an undergraduate student at Antioch and they were married in 1939. She
   assisted him in his research throughout his career. They both were a
   part of a big family where Lee had 2 brothers, Quent and Woodams Clark.
   They had four daughters.^[30][5]
