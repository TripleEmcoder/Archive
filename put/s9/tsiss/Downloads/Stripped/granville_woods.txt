   Granville T. Woods (April 23, 1856 – January 30, 1910), was an
   [11]African-American inventor who is famous as an American [12]inventor
   who holds more than 60 patents for inventions. Most of his work was on
   [13]trains and [14]street cars. Woods also invented the Multiplex
   Telegraph, a device that sent messages between moving trains and train
   stations. Born in Columbus, Ohio, on April 23, 1856, Granville T. Woods
   dedicated his life to developing a variety of inventions relating to
   the railroad industry.

[[19]edit] Early life

   Granville T. Woods literally learned his skills on the job. Attending
   school in Columbus until age 10, he served an apprenticeship in a
   machine shop and learned the trades of machinist and blacksmith. During
   his youth he also went to night school and took private lessons.
   Although he had to leave formal school at age ten, Woods realized that
   learning and education were essential to developing critical skills
   that would allow him to express his creativity with machinery. In 1872,
   Woods obtained a job as a fireman on the Danville and Southern Railroad
   in Nebraska, eventually becoming an engineer. He invested his spare
   time in studying electronics. In 1874, he moved to [20]Springfield,
   Illinois, and worked in a rolling mill. In 1878, he took a job aboard
   the Ironsides, a British steamer, and, within two years, became Chief
   Engineer of the steamer. Finally, his travels and experiences led him
   to settle in [21]Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became a person dedicated
   to modernizing the railroad.

[[22]edit] Inventions

   Woods developed several improvements to the railroad system, and was
   referred to by some as the "Black Edison."

   In 1885, Woods patented an apparatus which was a combination of a
   [23]telephone and a [24]telegraph. The device, which he called
   "telegraphony", would allow a telegraph station to send voice and
   telegraph messages over a single wire. He sold the rights to this
   device to the American Bell Telephone Company. In 1887, he patented the
   Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, which allowed communications
   between train stations from moving trains. [25]Thomas Edison later
   filled a claim to the ownership of this patent. In 1888, Woods
   manufactured a system of overhead electric conducting lines for
   railroads modeled after the system pioneered by [26]Charles van
   Depoele, a famed inventor who had by then installed his electric
   railway system in thirteen U.S. cities. In 1889, he filed a patent for
   an improvement to the steam-boiler furnace.

   Woods is sometimes credited with the invention of the electric
   [27]third rail, however, many third rail systems were in place in both
   Europe and North America at the time Woods filed for his patent in
   1901. [28]Thomas Edison had been awarded a patent for the third rail
   almost a decade earlier, in 1882.^[29][1]

   By the time of his death in 1910, Woods had made a successful career as
   an engineer and inventor.
