[[14]edit] Biography

   Stearns was the son of Edward Ray and Eliza Tyler Barker Stearns of
   [15]Weld, Maine. As a youth, he worked on a farm. He studied telegraphy
   at [16]Newburyport, Massachusetts, where he became manager of the
   office. From 1855 to 1869, he was superintendent of the Fire Alarm
   Telegraph Company of [17]Boston, Massachusetts and was the first to
   take out patents on the use of reversed currents in connection with the
   [18]fire alarm signal system.

   He was president of Franklin Telegraph Co., from 1869 to 1871, during
   which time he invented the first practical system of duplex telegraphy
   which was successfully applied to the English, French and Belgian
   lines. Two years later this system was used for the [19]Atlantic
   cables. He sold rights under his duplex patents to the Western Union
   Telegraph and Cable Companies, receiving large royalties for the use of
   his inventions from governments in [20]England, [21]France, [22]Italy,
   [23]Spain, [24]Belgium, [25]Russia and [26]India, and several
   [27]submarine cable companies. From 1879 to 1880, he was employed as
   engineer by the Mexican Telegraph Company in making, laying, and
   putting into operation the cables of that company between
   [28]Galveston, Texas, and [29]Vera Cruz, [30]Mexico. In 1881, he
   performed a similar service for the Central and South American
   Telegraph Company, whose cables extended from the [31]Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec in Mexico to [32]Callao, [33]Peru, in all between 4,000 and
   5,000 miles. This work he completed in 1882.

   He retired from active business in 1885 and settled in [34]Camden,
   Maine. There he had a library of 10,000 volumes, and a collection of
   [35]Chiriquí Province pottery, which was exhibited at the
   [36]Smithsonian Institution in [37]Washington, D.C.. He also had a
   collection of carved [38]ivories which was exhibited at the
   [39]Metropolitan Museum of Art in [40]New York City. He died in Camden.

[[41]edit] Family

   He had eight children. He got married on January 8, 1853, to Lois M.
   Brooks of [42]Putney, Vermont (born June 4, 1827; died July 29, 1861,
   in South Boston), then married Frances Amanda Edmonds of
   [43]Portsmouth, New Hampshire (born January 16, 1838) on June 6, 1866.

[[44]edit] Honors

   In 1872, the [45]American Institute of New York awarded him the Great
   Medal of Honor for the invention of the duplex telegraph.
