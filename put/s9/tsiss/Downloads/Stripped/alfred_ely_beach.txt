[[24]edit] Early years

   Beach was born in [25]Springfield, [26]Massachusetts and was the son of
   a prominent publisher, [27]Moses Beach. Alfred Beach worked for his
   father until he and a friend, [28]Orson Desaix Munn I, decided to buy
   [29]Scientific American, a relatively new publication. They ran
   Scientific American until their deaths decades later, and it was
   carried on by their sons and grandsons for decades more. Munn and Beach
   also established a very successful patent agency. Beach patented some
   of his own inventions, notably an early [30]typewriter designed for use
   by the blind. After the [31]Civil War he founded a school for freed
   slaves in Savannah, the [32]Beach Institute, which is now the home of
   the [33]King-Tisdell Cottage Foundation.^[34][1]

[[35]edit] Subway

   However, Beach's most famous invention was [36]New York City's first
   [37]subway, the [38]Beach Pneumatic Transit.

   By the 1860s traffic in New York was a nightmare, especially along the
   central artery, [39]Broadway. Beach was one of a few visionaries who
   proposed building an underground railway under Broadway to help relieve
   the traffic congestion. The inspiration was the underground
   [40]Metropolitan Railway in [41]London but in contrast to that and
   others' proposals for New York, Beach proposed the use of trains
   propelled by [42]pneumatics instead of conventional [43]steam engines,
   and construction using a [44]tunnelling shield of his invention to
   minimize disturbing the street.^[45][2]

   Beach was also interested in [46]pneumatic tubes for the transport of
   letters and packages, another idea recently put into use in
   London.^[47][3] With a franchise from the state he began construction
   of a tunnel for small pneumatic tubes in 1869, but diverted it into a
   demonstration of a passenger railway that opened on February 26,
   1870.^[48][4] To build a passenger railway he needed a different
   franchise, something he lobbied for over four legislative sessions,
   1870 to 1873. Construction of the tunnel was obvious from materials
   being delivered to Warren St near Broadway, and was documented in
   newspaper reports, but Beach kept all details secret until the [49]New
   York Tribune published a possibly planted article a few weeks before
   opening.^[50][5]
   Plan of the Beach Pneumatic Transit station and tunnel

   In 1870 state senator [51]William M. Tweed introduced a bill for
   Beach's subway that did not pass.^[52][6] By the end of 1871 Tweed's
   [53]Tammany Hall political machine was in disgrace and from then on
   Beach, in an effort to gain support from reformers, claimed that Tweed
   had opposed his subway.^[54][7] The real opposition to the subway was
   from politically connected property owners along Broadway, led by
   [55]Alexander Turney Stewart and [56]John Jacob Astor III, who feared
   that tunnelling would damage buildings and interfere with surface
   traffic.^[57][8] Bills for Beach's subway passed the legislature in
   1871 and 1872 but were vetoed by Governor [58]John T. Hoffman because
   he said that they gave away too much authority without compensation to
   the city or state. In 1873 Governor [59]John Adams Dix signed a similar
   bill into law, but Beach was not able to raise funds to build over the
   next six months, and then the [60]Panic of 1873 dried up the financial
   markets.^[61][2]

   During this same time, other investors had built an [62]elevated
   railway in Greenwich St and Ninth Ave, which operated successfully with
   a small steam engine starting in 1870. The wealthy property owners did
   not object to this railway well away from Broadway, and by the mid
   1870s it appeared that elevated railways were practical and underground
   railways were not, setting the pattern for rapid transit development in
   New York for the rest of the 19th century.^[63][2]

   Beach operated his demonstration railway from February 1870 to April
   1873. It had one station in the basement of Devlin's clothing store, a
   building at the southwest corner of Broadway and Warren St, and ran for
   a total of about 300 feet, first around a curve to the center of
   Broadway and then straight under the center of Broadway to the south
   side of Murray St.^[64][4] The former Devlin's building was destroyed
   by fire in 1898.^[65][9] In 1912 workers for Degnon Contracting
   excavated the tunnel proper during the construction of a subway line
   running under Broadway. The tunnel was completely within the limits of
   the present day [66]City Hall station under Broadway.^[67][10]

   Much of the Beach subway story was recalled as precedent by
   [68]Lawrence Edwards in his lead article of the August 1965 issue of
   Scientific American, which described his invention of
   [69]Gravity-Vacuum Transit.^[70][11]

   The Beach tunnelling shield was used in the construction of the Grand
   Trunk Railway of Canada's first St. Clair Tunnel between Port Huron,
   Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario. This tunnel opened in 1890.

[[71]edit] Death

   Beach died of [72]pneumonia on January 1, 1896 in [73]New York City at
   the age of 69.^[74][1]^[75][12]

[[76]edit] Popular culture

     * The song "[77]Sub-Rosa Subway", from the 1976 album [78]3:47 EST by
       Canadian progressive rock band [79]Klaatu, tells the story of
       Alfred Beach building his subway.

     * The second noted appearance was in the 1989 comedy [80]Ghostbusters
       II.

          The set featured artistic features (Specifically the vaulted
          arches and replica [81]Guastavino tile featured on the set)
          which were inspired primarily by the 1904 [82]City Hall station.
          The main inspiration from the real pneumatic railroad (excluding
          the history) was the tunnel entrance, featuring keystone
          dedication of "Pneumatic 1870 Transit".

          The history of the station would have been included in a deleted
          scene of dialogue between Dr. [83]Peter Venkman and Dr. [84]Egon
          Spengler as Dr. [85]Ray Stantz began to descend into the tunnel.

          Peter: "NYPR?"
          Egon: "The New York Pneumatic Railroad, fan forced air trains,
          built around 1870."

          It is not known if this scene was filmed as Ray entered the
          station, or, as suggested by [86]The Real Ghostbusters in
          Ghostbusters II when Ray removed a [87]manhole cover bearing the
          initials: "NYPRR".

     * Beach's Subway also makes an appearance in the fictional anthology
       [88]Wild Cards by [89]George R. R. Martin. In the episode "Down
       Deep" by Edward Bryant and Leanne C Harper, the character Sewer
       Jack has refurbished one of the ornate subway stations as a private
       abode.

     * [90]Alfred E. Beach High School, located in [91]Savannah, Georgia,
       is named in honor of Alfred Ely Beach.

     * A recent appearance of the Beach Subway was within [92]An American
       Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island. In the film, Fievel
       Mousekewitz and Tony venture into the disused 'Beachs pneumatic
       railroad' (sic), visiting the station; looking at the car and
       traveling into the tunnel. A brief and accurate description of the
       system was given by Tony, however due to the lack of surviving
       photographic reference of the real railway some artistic licences
       in design was taken by the artists, including a station entrance on
       the street which resembled the cast iron kiosk entrance used on the
       [93]IRT Subway in New York.

     * It was mentioned on [94]CSI: NY on 9/27/2006, as one of the many
       unused tunnels under the city.

     * Alfred Ely Beach and a fictional version of his subway work is a
       prominent feature in [95]Neal Shusterman's young adult novel,
       [96]Downsiders.
