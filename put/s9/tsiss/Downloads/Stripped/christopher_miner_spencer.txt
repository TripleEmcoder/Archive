   Christopher Spencer at about age 30

   Christopher Miner Spencer (June 20, 1833 – January 14, 1922) was an
   [8]American [9]inventor, from [10]Manchester, [11]Connecticut, who
   invented the [12]Spencer repeating rifle (one of the earliest models of
   lever-action rifle), a steam powered "[13]horseless carriage", and
   several other inventions. He developed the first [14]fully automatic
   turret lathe,^[15][1] which in its small- to medium-sized form is also
   known as a screw machine.

[[22]edit] Early years

   Spencer worked for [23]Samuel Colt’s factory, where he learned the
   arms-making trade.^[24][2]

[[25]edit] Civil War

   Although the Spencer rifle had been developed as early as 1859, it was
   not initially used by the [26]Union. On August 18, 1863, Christopher
   Spencer walked into the [27]White House carrying one of his [28]rifles
   and a supply of [29]cartridges. He walked past the sentries, and into
   [30]Abraham Lincoln's office. After some discussion, he returned the
   following afternoon, when Spencer and Lincoln were joined by [31]Edwin
   Stanton, [32]Secretary of War and other officials, and the group then
   proceeded to walk out on the [33]Mall. Near the site of the
   [34]Washington Monument, they engaged in [35]target shooting.

   Subsequent to that meeting, the [36]U.S ordered some 13,171 rifles and
   [37]carbines, along with some 58 million [38]rounds of [39]ammunition.
   This proved in part to be his undoing. The heavy expenses incurred in
   the manufacturing of these arms, as well as a glut of rifles on the
   market after the war resulted in the [40]Spencer Repeating Rifle
   Company declaring bankruptcy. All the assets were acquired by
   [41]Oliver Winchester.

[[42]edit] Post-Civil War

   In 1868, while at the Roper Repeating Arms Company in [43]Amherst,
   Massachusetts, he worked with [44]Charles E. Billings.^[45][2] Roper
   failed, and the following year, 1869, the two founded a partnership (in
   [46]Hartford, Connecticut) called [47]Billings & Spencer,^[48][2] which
   would manufacture [49]sewing machines, drop-forged [50]hand tools, and
   [51]machine tools.

   Around 1882, Spencer started a new company, the [52]Spencer Arms
   Company, in Windsor, Connecticut. Its most remarkable product was
   likely the Spencer Pump-Action Shotgun. Produced between 1882 and 1889,
   this was the first commercially successful slide-action (or
   pump-action) shotgun. Most were manufactured in 12-gauge with 10-gauge
   being an uncommon variant. Once again faced with financial hardships,
   Spencer's company and his patents were purchased circa 1890 by Francis
   Bannerman & Sons of New York who continued to manufacture his shotgun
   until around 1907.
