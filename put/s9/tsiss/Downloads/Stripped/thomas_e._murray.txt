   Thomas E. Murray (October 21, 1860 – July 21, 1929) was an [13]American
   [14]inventor and [15]businessman who developed [16]electric power
   plants for New York City as well as many electrical devices which
   influenced life around the world, including the [17]dimmer switch and
   [18]screw-in fuse. It has been said that he "invented everything from
   the power plant up to the light bulb".

   Murray is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history
   after [19]Thomas Edison, holding 462 U.S. [20]patents in his name.
   However, unlike Edison, Murray did not patent the work of others under
   his name; the employee would have the patent in their name, and assign
   it to the Murray company. Also, if Murray worked with anyone else on an
   invention, their name would be listed on the patent.
