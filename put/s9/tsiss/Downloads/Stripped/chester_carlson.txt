   Chester Floyd Carlson (February 8, 1906 – September 19, 1968) was an
   [24]American [25]physicist, [26]inventor, and [27]patent attorney born
   in [28]Seattle, [29]Washington.

   He is best known for having invented the process of
   [30]electrophotography, which produced a dry copy rather than a wet
   copy, as was produced by the [31]mimeograph process. Carlson's process
   was subsequently renamed to [32]xerography, a term that literally means
   "dry writing."

[[52]edit] Early life

   “ Work outside of school hours was a necessity at an early age, and
     with such time as I had I turned toward interests of my own devising,
     making things, experimenting, and planning for the future. I had read
     of [53]Thomas Alva Edison and other successful inventors, and the idea
     of making an invention appealed to me as one of the few available means
     to accomplish a change in one's economic status, while at the same time
     bringing to focus my interest in technical things and making it
     possible to make a contribution to society as well.                    ”

   —Chester Carlson, to A. Dinsdale^[54][1]

   Carlson's father, Olof Adolph Carlson, had little formal education but
   was described as "brilliant" by a relative. Carlson wrote of his
   mother, Ellen, that she "was looked up to by her sisters as one of the
   wisest."^[55][2]

   When Carlson was an infant, his father contracted [56]tuberculosis, and
   also later suffered from [57]arthritis of the spine (a common,
   age-related disease). When Olaf moved the family to Mexico for a
   seven-month period in 1910, in hopes of gaining riches through what
   Carlson described as "a crazy American land colonization scheme," Ellen
   contracted malaria.^[58][3] Because of his parents' illnesses, and the
   resulting poverty, Carlson worked to support his family from an early
   age; he began working odd jobs for money when he was eight. By the time
   he was thirteen, he would work for two or three hours before going to
   school, then go back to work after classes. By the time Carlson was in
   high school, he was his family's principal provider.^[59][4] His mother
   died of tuberculosis when he was 17, and his father died when Carlson
   was 27.

   Carlson began thinking about reproducing print early in his life. At
   age ten, he created a newspaper called This and That, created by hand
   and circulated among his friends with a routing list. His favorite
   plaything was a rubber stamp printing set, and his most coveted
   possession was a toy typewriter an aunt gave him for Christmas in
   1916—although he was disappointed that it was not an office
   typewriter.^[60][5]

   While working for a local printer while in high school, Carlson
   attempted to typeset and publish a magazine for science-minded students
   like himself. He quickly became frustrated with traditional duplicating
   techniques. As he told Dartmouth College professor Joseph J. Ermene in
   a 1965 interview, "That set me to thinking about easier ways to do
   that, and I got to thinking about duplicating methods."^[61][6]

[[62]edit] Education

   “ Well, I had a fascination with the [63]graphic arts from childhood.
     One of the first things I wanted was a [64]typewriter—even when I was
     in grammar school. Then, when I was in high school I liked
     [65]chemistry and I got the idea of publishing a little magazine for
     amateur chemists. I also worked for a printer in my spare time and he
     sold me an old [66]printing press which he had discarded. I paid for it
     by working for him. Then I started out to set my own type and print
     this little paper. I don't think I printed more than two issues, and
     they weren't much. However, this experience did impress me with the
     difficulty of getting words into hard copy and this, in turn, started
     me thinking about duplicating processes. I started a little inventor's
     notebook and I would jot down ideas from time to time.                 ”

   —Chester Carlson, to A. Dinsdale, when asked about his choice of
   field^[67][1]

   Because of the work he put in supporting his family, Carlson had to
   take a postgraduate year at his high school to fill in missed courses.
   He then entered a cooperative work/study program at [68]Riverside
   Junior College, working and going to classes in alternating six-week
   periods. Carlson held three jobs while at Riverside, paying for a cheap
   one-bedroom apartment for himself and his father. At Riverside, Chester
   began as a chemistry major, but switched to physics, largely due to a
   favorite professor.^[69][7]

   After three years at Riverside, Chester transferred to the
   [70]California Institute of Technology, or Caltech—his ambition since
   high school. His tuition, $260 a year, exceeded his total earnings, and
   the workload prevented him from earning much money—though he did mow
   lawns and do odd jobs on weekends, and work at a cement factory in the
   summer. By the time he graduated, he was $1,500 in debt.^[71][8] He
   graduated with good—but not exceptional—grades, earning a B.S. degree
   in Physics in 1930, near the start of the [72]Great Depression. He
   wrote letters seeking employment to 82 companies; none offered him a
   job.^[73][9]

[[74]edit] Early career

   “ The need for a quick, satisfactory copying machine that could be used
     right in the office seemed very apparent to me—there seemed such a
     crying need for it—such a desirable thing if it could be obtained. So I
     set out to think of how one could be made.                               ”

   —Chester Carlson^[75][10]

   As a last resort, he began working for [76]Bell Telephone Laboratories
   in [77]New York City as a research engineer. Finding the work dull and
   routine,^[78][11] After a year, Carlson transferred to the [79]patent
   department as an assistant to one of the company's patent attorneys.

   Carlson wrote over 400 ideas for new inventions in his personal
   notebooks while working at Bell Labs. He kept coming back to his love
   of printing, especially since his job in the patent department gave him
   new determination to find a better way to copy documents. "In the
   course of my patent work," wrote Carlson, "I frequently had need for
   copies of patent specifications and drawings, and there was no really
   convenient way of getting them at that time."^[80][9] At the time, the
   department primarily made copies by having typists retype the patent
   application in its entirety, using [81]carbon paper to make multiple
   copies at once. There were other methods available, such as
   [82]mimeographs and [83]Photostats, but they were more expensive than
   carbon paper, and they had other limitations that made them
   impractical.^[84][12] The existing solutions were 'duplicating'
   machines—they could make many duplicates, but one had to create a
   special master copy first, usually at great expense of time or money.
   Carlson wanted to invent a 'copying' machine, that could take an
   existing document and copy it onto a new piece of paper without any
   intermediate steps.

   In 1933, during the [85]Great Depression, Carlson was fired from Bell
   Labs for participating in a failed "business scheme" outside of the
   Labs with several other employees.^[86][13] After six weeks of
   job-hunting, he got a job at the firm Austin & Dix, near [87]Wall
   Street, but he left the job about a year later as the firm's business
   was declining. He got a better job at the electronics firm P. R.
   Mallory Company, founded by [88]Philip Mallory (now known as the
   [89]Duracell division of [90]Procter & Gamble), where Carlson was
   promoted to head of the patent department.

[[91]edit] The invention of electrophotography

   Further information: [92]Xerography
   “ There was a gap of some years, but by 1935 I was more or less
     settled. I had my job, but I didn't think I was getting ahead very
     fast. I was just living from hand to mouth, you might say, and I had
     just got married. It was kind of a hard struggle. So I thought the
     possibility of making an invention might kill two birds with one stone;
     it would be a chance to do the world some good and also a chance to do
     myself some good.                                                      ”

   —Chester Carlson, to A. Dinsdale^[93][1]

   In 1936, Carlson began to study law at night at [94]New York Law
   School, receiving his [95]LL.B. degree in 1939. He studied at the New
   York Public Library, copying longhand from law books there because he
   could not afford to buy them. The pains induced by this laborious
   copying hardened his resolve to find a way to build a true copying
   machine. He began supplementing his law studies with trips to the
   Public Library's science and technology department. It was there that
   he was inspired by a brief article, written by Hungarian physicist
   [96]Pál Selényi in an obscure German scientific journal, that showed
   him a way to obtain his dream machine.^[97][14]

   Carlson's early experiments, conducted in his apartment kitchen, were
   smoky, smelly, and occasionally explosive. In one set of experiments,
   he was melting pure crystalline sulfur (a photoconductor) onto a plate
   of zinc by moving it just so over the flame of his kitchen stove. This
   often resulted in a sulfur fire, filling the building with the smell of
   rotten eggs.^[98][15] In another experiment, the chemicals he was
   working with caught fire, and he and his wife were hard-pressed to
   extinguish the flames.^[99][16]

   During this period, he developed arthritis of the spine, like his
   father. He pressed on with his experiments, however, in addition to his
   law school studies and his regular job.

   Having learned about the value of patents in his early career as a
   patent clerk and attorney, Carlson patented his developments every step
   along the way. He filed his first preliminary patent application on
   October 18, 1937.

   By the fall of 1938, Carlson's wife had convinced him that his
   experiments needed to be conducted elsewhere. He rented a room on the
   second floor of a house owned by his mother-in-law at 32-05 37th Street
   in [100]Astoria, Queens. He hired an assistant, Otto Kornei, an
   out-of-work Austrian physicist.

   Carlson knew that several major corporations were researching ways of
   copying paper. The [101]Haloid Company had the [102]Photostat, which it
   licensed to [103]Eastman Kodak, the photography giant. However, these
   companies were researching along photographic lines, and their
   solutions required special chemicals and papers. The Photostat, for
   instance, was essentially a photograph of the document being copied.

[[104]edit] Electrophotography

   Further information: [105]Electrophotography

   Selényi's article described a way of transmitting and printing
   facsimilies of printed images using a beam of directed ions directed
   onto a rotating drum of insulating material. The ions would create an
   electrostatic charge on the drum. A fine powder could then be dusted
   upon the drum; the powder would stick to the parts of the drum that had
   been charged, much as a balloon will stick to a static-charged
   stocking.

   To this point, Carlson's apartment-kitchen experiments in constructing
   a copying machine had involved trying to generate an electric current
   in the original piece of paper using light. Selényi's article convinced
   Carlson to instead use light to 'remove' the static charge from a
   uniformly-ionized [106]photoconductor. As no light would reflect from
   the black marks on the paper, those areas would remain charged on the
   photoconductor, and would therefore retain the fine powder. He could
   then transfer the powder to a fresh sheet of paper, resulting in a
   duplicate of the original.^[107][17] This approach would give his
   invention an advantage over the Photostat, which could only create a
   [108]photographic negative of the original.
   [109]Astoria 10-22-38 (The first xerographic image)
   The world's first xerographic image^[110][18]

   On October 22, 1938, they had their historic breakthrough. Kornei wrote
   the words "10.-22.-38 ASTORIA." in [111]India ink on a glass
   [112]microscope slide. The Austrian prepared a [113]zinc plate with a
   [114]sulfur coating, darkened the room, rubbed the sulfur surface with
   a cotton handkerchief to apply an [115]electrostatic charge, then laid
   the slide on the plate, exposing it to a bright, [116]incandescent
   light. They removed the slide, sprinkled [117]lycopodium powder to the
   sulfur surface, softly blew the excess away, and transferred the image
   to a sheet of [118]wax paper. They heated the paper, softening the wax
   so the lycopodium would adhere to it, and had the world's first
   xerographic copy. After repeating the experiment to be sure it worked,
   Carlson celebrated taking Kornei out for a modest
   lunch.^[119][19]^[120][20]

   Kornei was not as excited about the results of the experiment as
   Carlson. Within a year, he left Carlson on cordial terms. His pessimism
   about electrophotography was so strong that he decided to dissolve his
   agreement with Carlson that would have given Kornei ten percent of
   Carlson's future proceeds from the invention and partial rights to the
   inventions they had worked on together.^[121][21] Years later, when
   Xerox stock was soaring, Carlson sent Kornei a gift of one hundred
   shares in the company.^[122][22] Had Kornei held onto that gift, it
   would have been worth more than $1 million by 1972.^[123][23]

   The road to his success—or that for xerography's success—had been long
   and filled with failure. From 1939 to 1944, his funding requests were
   turned down by more than twenty companies.^[124][24] He tried for some
   time to sell the invention to International Business Machines (IBM),
   the great vendor of office equipment, but no one at the company saw
   merit in the concept—it is not clear that anyone at IBM even
   'understood' the concept.^[125][25] His next-to-last attempt to garner
   the interest—and funds—he needed to commercialize the physics was a
   meeting with the Department of the Navy. The Navy had a specific
   interest in the production of dry copies but they did not "see" what
   Carlson saw.^[[126]citation needed]

   On October 6, 1942, the Patent Office issued Carlson's patent on
   electrophotography.^[127][26]

[[128]edit] Battelle Memorial Institute

   When Carlson was close to giving up on getting his invention from a
   proof-of-concept to a usable product, happenstance provided a solution.
   In 1944, Russell W. Dayton, a young engineer from the [129]Battelle
   Memorial Institute in [130]Columbus, Ohio, visited the patent
   department at Mallory where Carlson worked. Dayton, brought in as an
   expert witness in a patent appeal case by Mallory, seemed to Carlson to
   be "the kind of fellow who looked like he was interested in new
   ideas."^[131][27] Although Battelle had not previously developed ideas
   generated by others, Dayton was fascinated by Carlson's invention. When
   Carlson was invited to Columbus to demonstrate his invention, Dayton's
   statement to the Battelle scientists and engineers present showed that
   he understood the importance of Carlson's invention: "However crude
   this may seem, this is the first time any of you have seen a
   reproduction made without any chemical reaction and a dry process."

   Battelle took a risk on Carlson's invention, which seemed to come out
   of nowhere:

   Electrophotography had practically no foundation in previous scientific
   work. Chet put together a rather odd lot of phenomena, each of which
   was obscure in itself and none of which had previously been related in
   anyone's thinking. The result was the biggest thing in imaging since
   the coming of photography itself. Furthermore, he did it entirely
   without the help of a favorable scientific climate. There are dozens of
   instances of simultaneous discovery down through scientific history,
   but no one came anywhere near being simultaneous with Chet. I'm as
   amazed by his discovery now as I was when I first heard of it.

   —Dr. Harold E. Clark, Battelle Memorial Institute, New Yorker,
   1967^[132][28]

   By the fall of 1945, Battelle agreed to act as Carlson's agent for his
   patents, pay for further research, and develop the idea. Battelle tried
   to interest major printing and photography companies, like Eastman
   Kodak and Harris-Seybold, to license the idea, but to no avail.

[[133]edit] Haloid Company

   The commercial breakthrough came when John Dessauer, chief of research
   at the Haloid Company, read an article about Carlson's invention.
   Haloid, a manufacturer of photographic paper, was looking for a way out
   of the shadow of its Rochester, New York neighbor, Eastman Kodak.
   Through previous acquisitions, Haloid was already in the
   duplicating-machine business; Dessauer thought that electrophotography
   might allow Haloid to expand into a new field that Kodak did not
   dominate.^[134][29]

   In December 1946, Battelle, Carlson, and Haloid signed the first
   agreement to license electrophotography for a commercial product. The
   $10,000 contract—representing ten percent of Haloid's total earnings
   from 1945—granted a nonexclusive right to make electophotography-based
   copying machines intended to make no more than twenty copies of an
   original. Both sides were tentative; Battelle was concerned by Haloid's
   relatively small size, and Haloid had concerns about
   electrophotography's viability.^[135][30]

   During this period, Battelle conducted most of the basic research into
   electrophotography, while Haloid concentrated on trying to make a
   commercial product out of the results. In 1948, Haloid's CEO, Joseph
   Wilson, convinced the U.S. Army Signal Corps to invest $100,000 in the
   technology, an amount that would double later. The Signal Corps was
   concerned about nuclear war. The traditional photographic techniques
   they used for reconnaissance would not function properly when exposed
   to the radiation from a nuclear attack; the film would fog, much as
   consumer photographic film can be fogged by an airport X-ray machine.
   The Signal Corps thought that electrophotography might be developed
   into a product that would be immune to such radiation. Through the
   1950s, over half the money Battelle spent developing electrophotography
   came from government contracts.^[136][31]

   In 1947, Carlson was becoming worried that Battelle was not developing
   electrophotography quickly enough; his patent would expire in ten
   years. After meeting with Joe Wilson, Carlson accepted an offer to
   become a consultant to Haloid. He and his wife Dorris moved to the
   Rochester area, to be near the company's base of operations.

   After years of trying to interest additional licensees in
   electrophotography, Battelle agreed to renegotiate with Haloid, making
   them the exclusive licensee for the invention (except for a few minor
   uses that Battelle wished to retain for itself).^[137][32]

[[138]edit] Xerox

   Main article: [139]Xerox
   “ What Bell is to the telephone—or, more aptly, what Eastman is to
     photography—Haloid could be to xerography.                          ”

   —Chester Carlson, letter to Joseph Wilson, 1953^[140][33]

[[141]edit] Xerography

   By 1948, Haloid realized that they would have to make a public
   announcement about electrophotography in order to retain their claims
   to the technology. However, the term electrophotography troubled
   Haloid; for one thing, its use of the term "photography" invited
   unwelcome comparisons with traditional duplicating technologies. After
   considering several options, Haloid chose a term invented by a
   public-relations employee at Battelle, who had asked a classics
   professor at Ohio State University for ideas. The professor suggested
   the term xerography—formed by combining the Greek words xeros ("dry")
   and graphein ("writing"). Carlson was not fond of the name, but
   Haloid's Wilson liked it, and so Haloid's board of directors voted to
   adopt it. The company's patent department wanted to trademark
   "xerography;" Haloid's head of sales and advertising, John Hartnett,
   vetoed the idea: "Don't do that. We want people to use the
   word."^[142][34]

[[143]edit] XeroX Model A

   On October 22, 1948, ten years to the day after that first
   [144]microscope slide was copied, the Haloid Company made the first
   public announcement of xerography. In 1949, they shipped the first
   commercial photocopier: the XeroX Model A Copier, known inside the
   company as the "Ox Box." The Model A was difficult to use, requiring
   thirty-nine steps to make a copy, as the process was mostly manual. The
   product would likely have been a failure, except that it turned out to
   be a good way to make paper masters for offset printing presses, even
   with the difficulty of use. Sales of the Model A to the printing
   departments of companies like [145]Ford Motor Company kept the product
   alive.^[146][35]

   Before the Model A, in order to make a paper lithographic master for a
   lithographic press like the Multigraph 1250, one had two choices: Type
   up a new master using wax-coated carbon paper on a special master
   sheet, or use a metal plate coated with a modified silver halide
   photographic emulsion. If retyping the document was not feasible, the
   photographic method could be used, but it was slow, expensive, and
   messy. Because the Model A's toner repelled water but attracted
   oil-based inks, a lithographic master could be made easily by simply
   making a copy of the document with the Model A onto a blank paper
   master. It reduced the cost of creating a lithographic master for an
   existing document from three dollars to less than forty cents. Ford
   saved so much money by using the Model A that the savings were
   specifically mentioned in one of Ford's annual reports.^[147][36]

   After the Model A, Haloid released a number of xerographic copiers to
   the market, but none yet particularly easy to use. Meanwhile,
   competitors such as Kodak and [148]3M brought out their own copying
   devices using other technologies. Kodak's Verifax, for instance, could
   sit on one side of a desk and sold for $100; Haloid's competing
   machines were more expensive and substantially larger.^[149][37]

[[150]edit] Haloid Xerox

   In 1955, Haloid signed a new agreement with Battelle granting them full
   title to Carlson's xerography patents, in exchange for fifty thousand
   shares of Haloid stock.^[151][38] Carlson received forty percent of the
   cash and stock from that deal, due to his agreement with
   Battelle.^[152][39] That same year, in order to exploit those patents
   in Europe, it partnered with the British motion-picture company
   [153]Rank Organisation in a joint venture called [154]Rank
   Xerox.^[155][38]

   Haloid needed to grow, and its existing offices in Rochester were old
   and scattered. In 1955, the company purchased a large parcel of land in
   the Rochester suburb of Webster, New York; this would eventually become
   the company's main research-and-development campus.^[156][40]

   Haloid's CEO, Joseph Wilson, had decided Haloid needed a new name as
   early as 1954. After years of debate within the company, the board
   approved a name change to "Haloid Xerox" in 1958, reflecting the fact
   that xerography was now the company's main line of business.^[157][41]

[[158]edit] The Xerox 914

   The first device recognizable as a modern photocopier was the Xerox
   914. Although large and crude by modern standards, it allowed an
   operator to place an original on a sheet of glass, press a button, and
   receive a copy on plain paper. Manufactured in a leased building off
   Orchard Street in Rochester, the 914 was introduced to the market at
   the [159]Sherry Netherland Hotel in New York City on September 16,
   1959. Even plagued with early problems—of the two demonstration units
   at the hotel, one caught fire, and one worked fine—the Xerox 914 became
   massively successful. Between 1959, when the Model 914 first shipped,
   and 1961, Haloid Xerox's revenues nearly doubled.

   The 914's success was not only due to its relative ease of use, its
   design (that, unlike competing copiers, carried no risk of damage to
   the original), and its low operating costs compared to other machines
   that required special paper; Haloid Xerox's decision to rent the 914—at
   the price of $25 per month, plus the cost of copies at four cents each
   with a minimum of $49 per month—made it vastly more affordable than a
   similar competing copier.^[160][42]

   In 1961, because of the success of the Xerox 914, the company changed
   its name again, to Xerox Corporation.^[161][43]

   For Carlson, the commercial success of the Xerox 914 was the
   culmination of his life's work: a device that could quickly and cheaply
   make an exact copy of an existing document. After the 914 went into
   production, Carlson's involvement with Xerox declined as he began
   pursuing his philanthropic interests.^[162][44]

[[163]edit] Personal life

   In the fall of 1934, Carlson married Elsa von Mallon, whom he had met
   at a YWCA party in New York City. Carlson described the marriage as "an
   unhappy period interspersed with sporadic escapes."^[164][45] They were
   divorced in 1945.

   Carlson married his second wife, Dorris Helen Hudgins, while the
   negotiations between Battelle and Haloid were under way.

[[165]edit] Later life

   “ To know Chester Carlson was to like him, to love him, and to respect
     him. He was generally known as the inventor of xerography, and although
     it was an extraordinary achievement in the technological and scientific
     field, I respected him more as a man of exceptional moral stature and
     as a humanist. His concern for the future of the human situation was
     genuine, and his dedication to the principles of the United Nations was
     profound. He belonged to that rare breed of leaders who generate in our
     hearts faith in man and hope for the future.                           ”

   —U Thant, secretary-general, United Nations, at the Xerox memorial
   service for Chester Carlson

   In 1951, Carlson's royalties from Battelle amounted to about $15,000
   (in current terms, $127 thousand). Carlson continued to work at Haloid
   until 1955, and he remained a consultant to the company until his
   death. From 1956 to 1965, he continued to earn royalties on his patents
   from Xerox, amounting to about one-sixteenth of a cent for every Xerox
   copy made worldwide.^[166][39]

   In 1968, Fortune magazine ranked Carlson among the wealthiest people in
   America. He sent them a brief letter: "Your estimate of my net worth is
   too high by $150 million. I belong in the 0 to $50 million bracket."
   This was because Carlson had spent years quietly giving most of his
   fortune away. He told his wife his remaining ambition was "to die a
   poor man."^[167][39]

   Carlson devoted his wealth to philanthropic purposes. He donated over
   $150 million to charitable causes and was an active supporter of the
   [168]NAACP. Carlson's wife Dorris got him interested in Hinduism,
   particularly the ancient texts known as the Vedanta, as well as in Zen
   Buddhism.^[169][39] They hosted Buddhist meetings, with meditation, at
   their home. After reading [170]Philip Kapleau's book The Three Pillars
   of Zen, Dorris invited Kapleau to join their meditation group; in June
   1966, they provided the funding that allowed Kapleau to start the
   [171]Rochester Zen
   Center.^[172][46]^[173][47]^[174][48]^[175][49]^[176][50]^[177][51]
   Dorris paid for 1,400 acres (5.7 km^2) of land that became [178]Dai
   Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji, a Zen monastery in the [179]Catskill Mountains
   of New York lead by [180]Eido Tai Shimano.^[181][52] Carlson had
   purchased a New York City carriage house for use by Shimano; he died
   four days after it was dedicated.^[182][52] Carlson is still
   commemorated in special services by Shimano; his dharma name, Daitokuin
   Zenshin Carlson Koji, is mentioned.^[183][53]

   In his essay "Half a Career with the Paranormal," researcher [184]Ian
   Stevenson describes Carlson's philanthropic style. According to
   Stevenson, Carlson's wife, Dorris, had some skill at extrasensory
   perception, and convinced Carlson to help support Stevenson's research.
   Carlson not only made annual donations to the [185]University of
   Virginia to fund Stevenson's work, but in 1964 he made a particularly
   large donation that helped fund one of the first [186]endowed chairs at
   the University. Stevenson was the first incumbent of this
   chair.^[187][54]

   Although Carlson insisted on anonymous donations, wrote Stevenson, he
   was unusual in that he closely followed the details of the research,
   maintaining contact with Stevenson. "He rarely made suggestions, but
   what he said always deserved attention," wrote Stevenson.^[188][54]

   In the spring of 1968, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Carlson had
   his first heart attack. He was gravely ill, but hid this from his wife,
   embarking on a number of unexpected household improvements and
   concealing his doctor's visits. On September 19, 1968, Carlson died of
   a heart attack in the Festival Theatre, on West 57th Street in New York
   City, while watching the film [189]He Who Rides a Tiger. Dorris
   arranged a small service in New York City; Xerox held a much larger
   service in the corporate auditorium in Rochester on September 26,
   1968.^[190][55]^[191][56]

[[192]edit] Legacy

   The [193]New York Civil Liberties Union was among the beneficiaries of
   his bequests.^[[194]citation needed] The University of Virginia
   received $1 million,^[195][54] under strict instructions that the money
   was to be used only to fund parapsychology research.^[196][57] The
   [197]Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions received a bequest
   of over $4.2 million from Carlson, in addition to the more than $4
   million he had contributed while alive.^[198][58]^[199][59]

   In 1981 Carlson was inducted into the [200]National Inventors Hall of
   Fame.

   United States Public Law 100-548, signed into law by [203]Ronald
   Reagan, designated October 22, 1988 as "National Chester F. Carlson
   Recognition Day". He was honored by the [204]United States Postal
   Service with a 21¢ [205]Great Americans series [206]postage
   stamp.^[207][60]

   Carlson is memorialized by buildings at the two largest institutions of
   higher learning in [208]Rochester, New York, Xerox's hometown. The
   Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, a department of the
   [209]Rochester Institute of Technology, specializes in remote sensing,
   eye tracking, and xerography.^[210][61] The [211]University of
   Rochester's Carlson Science and Engineering Library is the University's
   primary library for the science and engineering disciplines.^[212][62]

   The following awards are named in Carlson's honor:
     * American Society for Engineering Education: The Chester F. Carlson
       Award is presented annually to an individual innovator in
       engineering education who, by motivation and ability to extend
       beyond the accepted tradition, has made a significant contribution
       to the profession.^[213][63]
     * Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science, IVA: The Chester
       Carlson Award recognizes persons or institutions for significant
       research or development within the area of information
       science.^[214][64]
