[[16]edit] Biography

   Born in [17]Hopewell, New York, Uncle Dan LeFever's gunmaking career
   began as an apprentice in [18]Canandaigua, New York in the early 1850s.
   He married Sarah Stead on June 10, 1857, in Canandaigua. He opened his
   own gunshop in Canandaigua in 1857. His principal business was making
   muzzle-loading rifles. In 1862 he joined with James Ellis to form
   LeFever & Ellis. They built long-range rifles which were used in the
   [19]American Civil War. This partnership broke up in 1867.

[[20]edit] Gun manufactory

   Sometime before 1870 D. M. LeFever moved to [21]Auburn, New York where
   he joined with Francis Dangerfield to form Dangerfield & LeFever. This
   firm made primarily [22]breechloading double [23]shotguns. They also
   converted muzzle loading guns to breech loading. This firm dissolved in
   late 1873 or early 1874.

   In early 1874 D. M. LeFever moved to [24]Syracuse, New York. Here he
   joined with Lorenzo Barber to form Barber & LeFever. Again they made
   breech loading shotguns and rifles. This partnership lasted a short two
   years.

   D. M. LeFever then joined with John Nichols and formed Nichols &
   LeFever. During this time D. M. LeFever worked on the development of
   the [25]hammerless shotgun. These guns were cocked with a cocking lever
   on the side of the breech. In 1878 he won first prize at the St. Louis
   Bench Show and Sportman's Association for the best breech-loading
   shotgun in America.

[[26]edit] Automatic hammerless shotgun

   By the time D. M. LeFever patented his hammerless shotgun in 1880 he
   had left Nichols & LeFever and gone into business for himself. In 1883
   D. M. LeFever patented the first truly automatic hammerless shotgun.
   This internalized the cocking mechanism so that the gun was
   automatically cocked when the breech was closed. He also patented the
   automatic ejector system which ejected the used shells when the breech
   was opened. In 1886 D. M. LeFever lost control of his company which by
   then was called LeFever Arms Company. However, he remained as
   superintendent until 1902.

   In 1902 D. M. LeFever left LeFever Arms Company to form D. M. LeFever,
   Sons & Company with sons Charles F. LeFever (also known as Fred who
   later invented the Model 25 Daisy BB pump gun^[27][1]), Frank, and
   George. They continued to make fine hammerless shotguns, but could not
   compete with the larger [28]LeFever Arms Company. In 1904 they moved to
   [29]Ohio, first in [30]Defiance and within a year in [31]Bowling Green.
   In 1906 they returned to [32]Syracuse, New York, however, before being
   able to re-establish a viable company D. M. LeFever died on October 29
   in [33]Syracuse of a [34]stomach ulcer. His remains are interred, with
   his wife (who died in 1898), in Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse.
   LeFever Arms Co. Optimus Grade shotgun

   The [35]Lefever Arms Company continued to make fine LeFever designed
   shotguns in [36]Syracuse until 1916 when they were purchased by the
   [37]Ithaca Gun Company. Ithaca continued to produce LeFever-designed
   guns under the [38]Lefever Arms Company name in [39]Ithaca, New York
   until 1921. These were made using primarily left-over parts from the
   Syracuse operation. Shortly after that the [40]Ithaca Gun Company used
   the LeFever name to market an inexpensive gun, the "LeFever Nitro
   Special", that was of their own design, having nothing to do with D. M.
   LeFever except to exploit his name. These were manufactured until the
   early 1940s.

   Many collectors^[[41]who?] consider original "D.M. LeFever" guns to be
   the finest ever produced in America.

[[42]edit] Uncle Dan LeFever Cup

   The LeFever Arms Collectors Association created the "Uncle Dan LeFever
   Cup" in honor of the legacy of D.M. LeFever. The "Uncle Dan LeFever
   Cup" shoot-off is held annually during a LACA designated trap shoot
   event. The highest scoring shooter wins a trophy engraved with the year
   the champion won. Only LACA members, firing LeFever guns, are eligible
   for the award. The first "Uncle Dan LeFever Cup" was awarded during the
   Greater Northeast Side by Side in [43]Friendsville, PA, on June 6,
   2010. LACA intends to hold the next shoot-off during the 2011 Nimrod
   Classic in [44]Bozeman, MT.^[45][2]
