             L.A.M. Phelan
      Born    late 19th c.
      Died    20th c.
   Occupation businessman and inventor

   L.A.M. Phelan was an American [7]businessman and [8]inventor. He is
   known mainly as inventor of the [9]broaster equipment and method for
   [10]pressure-cooking [11]chicken, and [12]founder of the Broaster
   Company.

[[13]edit] Biography

   In the late 19th century and early 20th century Phelan worked on
   invention and development with [14]Goodyear, [15]Monsanto Company,
   [16]American Car and Foundry, and [17]Allis-Chalmers, on the [18]Panama
   Canal project, as well others in the fields of [19]carton making,
   [20]oil burners, and [21]steam traps.^[22][1]

   In the 1910s Phelan invented and developed various forms of the
   [23]mercury switch, on which he obtained 52 patents. In 1920 he formed
   the Absolute Con-Tac-Tor Corporation to manufacture and market
   [24]contactor mercury switches^[25][2]. Through a series of mergers,
   this technology became an important early product of
   [26]Honeywell^[27][3].

   In the 1930s Phelan took over and ran the Taylor Company, now a
   subsidiary of [28]Carrier Corporation, manufacturer of conventional and
   [29]soft serve commercial [30]ice cream freezers. In 1946 he organized
   more than 40 of Taylor's employees as Tekni-Craft, one of America's
   first [31]worker cooperatives, to which he sold Taylor's manufacturing
   and distribution rights^[32][4]. Phelan also invented the "Zest-O-Mat"
   [33]frozen custard freezer and founded [34]Zesto Products Dairy, which
   grew into a chain of more than 50 drive-in restaurants^[35][5] .

   From 1936 to 1949 he operated a manufacturer of [36]X-ray tubes.

   In the early 1950s, approximately the same time as [37]Colonel Sanders
   began franchising his [38]KFC restaurant chain, Phelan developed the
   [39]broasting method of cooking chicken, for which he invented a
   modified commercial-grade [40]pressure cooker. He founded the Broaster
   Company in 1956 to manufacture and market the machines.
