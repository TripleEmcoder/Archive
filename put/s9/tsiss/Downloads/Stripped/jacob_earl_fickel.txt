[[24]edit] Biography

   Fickel enlisted in the Regular Army when he was twenty one years of
   age. He served as a private, corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant of
   Company K, 27th Infantry. He was stationed at [25]Fort Hayes, [26]Fort
   Sheridan and [27]Fort Leavenworth. In 1907 Fickel was commissioned as a
   second lieutenant of Infantry. He then joined the 29th Infantry at
   [28]Fort Douglas. In August of that year he went with that regiment for
   the Philippine Islands and served at [29]Fort William McKinley with 2d
   Lt. [30]Henry H. Arnold. In 1909 Fickel returned to the United States
   for station at [31]Fort Jay. He was there through 1911. He then went to
   [32]Fort Niagara until November 1913.^[33][1]

   Fickel then went for a second tour of duty in the Philippine Islands
   with the 13th Infantry. He served at Fort William McKinley again and at
   Camp McGrath until March 1917. He was then assigned to duty as an
   instructor at the Officers Training Camp at [34]Fort Benjamin Harrison.
   There he remained until November of that year. Fickel was then ordered
   to Washington, D.C., for duty with the Headquarters of the Aviation
   Section of the Signal Corps. He served in that capacity until May
   1918.^[35][1]

   Fickel was next ordered to [36]Rockwell Field in California as a
   student officer at the flying school. Upon completion of his course in
   November 1918 he assumed command of [37]Carruthers Field in Texas where
   he remained until January 1919. Fickel was then ordered back to
   Washington, D.C. There he served in the Office of the Chief of Air
   Service until March 1921. His next duty was with the [38]Spruce
   Production Corporation Portland, Oregon. There he served until the
   summer of 1922. He then returned to Washington for a two-year tour of
   duty as Chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service.^[39][1]

   In June 1925 Fickel graduated from the Air Corps Technical School at
   [40]Langley Field. In June 1926 he also graduated from the Command and
   General Staff School at [41]Fort Leavenworth. His next tour of duty was
   to serve as Executive of the Materiel Division at [42]McCook Field
   until April 1927. He then attended the Air Corps Advanced Flying School
   at [43]Kelly Field in Texas for three months. Fickel then returned to
   McCook Field where he reassumed the duties of Executive Officer,
   Materiel Division, for a period of three years.^[44][1]

   Fickel then attended the Army War College in Washington, D.C. He
   graduated in June 1931. His next duty was as Chief of the Buildings and
   Grounds Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps, Washington,
   D.C. He was there until January 1935. From February 1935 to June 1936,
   Fickel was Commandant of the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly
   Field. His next tour of duty was as Air Officer of the Ninth Corps
   Area, with Headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco, California.
   He was there until March 1939. He was then assigned to command the
   [45]1st Wing, General Headquarters Air Force at [46]March Field in
   California.

   In February 1940, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Air Corps in
   Washington, D.C. He was later assigned to Riverside, California, in
   1940, as Air District Commander, becoming the first Commanding General
   of the [47]Fourth Air Force on December 18, 1940. After an inordinately
   high rate of accidents involving [48]Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in his
   command, he was relieved of command on April 2, 1942, on the orders of
   his friend Hap Arnold, now commanding the [49]Army Air Forces, and
   reassigned to command the District No. 3 (Western) Technical Training
   Command, Oklahoma, on March 5, 1942. Fickel retired in 1946.^[50][1]

[[51]edit] Notability

   Lieutenant Jacob Earl Fickel with [52]Glenn H. Curtiss experimenting
   shooting from an airplane in 1910

   Fickel is credited with firing the first recorded gunshot ever from an
   airplane on August 20, 1910.^[53][2] From his passenger seat he fired a
   rifle twice at a target from an altitude of 100 feet with [54]Glenn H.
   Curtiss flying the airplane. It was done at [55]Sheepshead Bay Race
   Track near New York City. This proved that a gun could be fired from an
   airplane without the plane breaking up into pieces due to the gun’s
   recoil.^[56][3]

   He repeated the feat at an air show in the summer of 1911 at [57]Nassau
   Boulevard airfield on [58]Long Island with Arnold at the controls.
   Competing against a team of Britons, [59]Thomas Sopwith and [60]Malcolm
   Campbell, the Americans won easily when Fickel displayed a skill that
   enabled him to put six bullets through a dinner plate from an aircraft
   flying 200 feet (61 m) off the ground.^[61][4]

   Fickel became the first aerial gunner in America. These experiments led
   to low recoil machine guns. Soon thereafter machine guns were added to
   planes for air-to-ground attack or air-to-air fighting. The first
   airplane machine guns were patented by Samuel Neal McClean. He sold his
   rights to the Automatic Arms Company in late 1910. Issac N. Lewis
   working for the company later improved the technology on this airplane
   machine gun system.^[62][5]

   The first use of an airplane machine gun in combat was in August 1914
   with the first recorded airplane shot down in air-to-air fighting in
   October of that year. By 1915 air combat was an integral part of World
   War I fighting.^[63][5]

   Gen. Fickel was the brother-in-law of glider pioneer, [64]Lawrence
   Malcolm Allison, of Lawrence, Kansas.
