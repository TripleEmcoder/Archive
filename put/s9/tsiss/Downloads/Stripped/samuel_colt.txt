   Samuel Colt (19th century engraving)

   Samuel Colt (July 19, 1814 – January 10, 1862) was an [8]American
   [9]inventor and [10]industrialist. He was the founder of Colt's Patent
   Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company (now known as [11]Colt's Manufacturing
   Company), and is widely credited with popularizing the [12]revolver.
   Colt's innovative contributions to the weapons industry have been
   described by arms historian James E. Serven as "events which shaped the
   destiny of American Firearms."^[13][1] In 2006, he was inducted into
   the [14]National Inventors Hall of Fame.^[15][2]

[[27]edit] Early years

   Samuel Colt was born in [28]Hartford, Connecticut, to Christopher Colt,
   a farmer who had moved his family to Hartford when he changed
   professions and became a businessman, and Sarah Colt née Caldwell, who
   died before Samuel was seven years old. Christopher Colt was remarried
   two years later to Olive Sargeant. The Colt family included eight
   siblings: five boys and three girls. Two of the sisters died in
   childhood and the other committed suicide later in life, but Samuel's
   brothers were a huge part of his professional life.

   Colt was [29]indentured to a farm in [30]Glastonbury at age 11, where
   he did chores and attended school. At Glastonbury, he was introduced to
   the [31]Compendium of Knowledge, a scientific encyclopedia that he
   preferred to read rather than doing his [32]Bible studies. This
   encyclopedia contained articles on [33]Robert Fulton and [34]gunpowder,
   both of which provided motivation and ideas that would influence Colt
   throughout his life. While reading the Compendium, "he discovered that
   Robert Fulton and several other inventors had accomplished things
   deemed impossible—until they were done". Later, after hearing soldiers
   talk about the success of the double barreled [35]rifle and the
   impossibility of a gun that could shoot five or six times, Colt
   "decided he would be an inventor and create the 'impossible'
   gun".^[36][3]

   In 1829, Colt began working in his father's [37]textile plant in
   [38]Ware, [39]Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials,
   and the factory workers' expertise. Using the ideas and technical
   knowledge he had acquired earlier from the encyclopedia, Samuel built a
   homemade [40]galvanic cell and used it to explode a gunpowder charge in
   the waters of Ware Lake. In 1832, Colt's father sent him to sea to
   learn the seaman's trade. Colt would later say that the concept of the
   revolver was inspired by his observations of the ship's wheel during
   his first voyage. He discovered that "regardless of which way the wheel
   was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a [41]clutch that
   could be set to hold it... the revolver was conceived!" On this voyage,
   Colt made a wooden model of a revolver.^[42][4]

   When Colt returned to the United States in 1832, he went back to work
   for his father, who financed the production of two [43]pistols. The
   guns turned out to be of poor quality because Christopher Colt believed
   the idea to be folly and would hire only inexpensive mechanics. One of
   the guns burst upon firing, and the other would not fire at all. Later,
   after learning about [44]nitrous oxide (laughing gas) from the factory
   chemist, Colt took a portable lab on the road and earned a living
   performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and
   Canada. It was during this time that he made arrangements to begin
   building guns using proper [45]gunsmiths from [46]Baltimore,
   [47]Maryland. In 1832, at the age of 18, Colt applied for a [48]patent
   on his revolver and declared that he would "be back soon with a
   model".^[49][4]

[[50]edit] Gunsmithing

   In 1835, Samuel Colt traveled to [51]England, following in the
   footsteps of [52]Elisha Collier, a [53]Bostonian who had patented a
   revolving [54]flintlock. Despite the reluctance of English officials to
   issue the patent, no fault could be found with the gun and he was
   issued his first patent (Number 6909). He then traveled to [55]France
   to promote his invention, and there he heard about the emerging
   conflict between the United States and Germany^[[56]citation needed].
   Colt wanted to serve his country, so he returned home. Upon his return,
   however, he learned that England had mediated the conflict and that
   there would be no fighting, so he set up a factory for the manufacture
   of his [57]firearms in [58]Paterson, [59]New Jersey. Shortly after his
   return to the United States, Colt applied for a patent for a "revolving
   gun", and he was granted the patent on 25 February 1836 (later numbered
   9430X).^[60][5] This instrument and patent No. 1304, dated August 29,
   1836, protected the basic principles of his revolving-breech loading,
   folding trigger firearm named the [61]Paterson Pistol.^[62][6]^[63][7]

   Colt never claimed to have invented the revolver, as his design was
   merely a more practical adaption of Collier's revolving flintlock,
   which was patented in England and achieved great popularity
   there.^[64][8] He did, however, greatly contribute to the use of
   [65]interchangeable parts. "Unhappy with high cost of hand made guns,
   and with the knowledge that some parts of guns were currently being
   made by machine, Colt wanted all the parts on every Colt gun to be
   interchangeable and made by machine. His goal was the [66]assembly
   line".^[67][9] This is shown clearly in a letter that Samuel Colt wrote
   to his father in which he said, "The first workman would receive two or
   three of the most important parts…and would affix these and pass them
   on to the next who add a part and pass the growing article on to
   another who would do the same, and so on until the complete arm is put
   together".^[68][10]

   It was this first "practical revolver and the first practical repeating
   firearm," made possible by converging percussion technology, that would
   be the genesis of what would later germinate into an industrial and
   cultural legacy and a priceless contribution to the development of
   [69]war [70]technology, ironically personified in the name of one of
   his later revolving innovations, the [71]Peacemaker.^[72][10] Colt
   quickly formed a corporation of [73]New York and New Jersey [74]venture
   capitalists in April 1836. Through the political connections of the
   subscribers, the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New
   Jersey, was chartered by the New Jersey legislature on March 5, 1837.
   Colt was given a [75]commission for each gun sold in exchange for his
   share of patent rights, and stipulated the return of the rights if the
   company disbanded.

[[76]edit] Early problems and failures

   Because the company's owners were reluctant to fund the new machinery
   to make the [77]interchangeable parts, Colt went back on the road to
   raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in [78]general stores did
   not work, so with a loan from a cousin he went to Washington, D.C., and
   demonstrated it to President [79]Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of
   the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. With that approval, Colt got a
   bill through [80]Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military,
   but no appropriation for them to purchase the weapon. A promising order
   from the state of [81]South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols
   was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough. One
   recurring problem Colt had in selling his revolvers was that "it was
   not possible to change the provisions of the Militia Act of 1808. Any
   arms purchased under the Militia Act had to be those in the current
   service to the [82]United States".^[83][11] In other words, state
   [84]militias could not officially allocate funds towards the purchase
   of weapons not also used by the [85]United States military.

   When [86]Martin Van Buren assumed the [87]Presidency in 1837, the
   ensuing [88]economic crash almost ruined Colt's company. The company
   was saved by the [89]war against the [90]Seminoles in [91]Florida which
   provided the first sale of Colt's revolvers and his new revolving
   [92]muskets. The soldiers in Florida loved the new weapon, but "the
   unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time ... led to
   difficulty training men used to exposed-hammer guns and many curious
   soldiers took the locks apart. This resulted in breakage of parts,
   stripped screw heads, and jammed actions".^[93][12] Colt soon reworked
   his design to leave the firing [94]hammer exposed, but problems
   continued and in late 1843, after numerous setbacks including loss of
   payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson, New Jersey plant closed.

[[95]edit] The two Sams

   Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing. Soon after the failure of
   his former company, while he was marketing the underwater electrical
   [96]detonators that he had invented, Colt met [97]Samuel Morse. They
   became friends and they both lobbied the U.S. government for funds.
   Colt's waterproof cable was valuable when Morse ran [98]telegraph lines
   under lakes and rivers, and bays, and especially for attempts to lay a
   [99]telegraph line across the entire [100]Atlantic Ocean.

   When tensions with Great Britain prompted Congress to appropriate funds
   for Colt's project toward the end of 1841, he demonstrated his
   underwater [101]mines to the U.S. government. In 1842 he used the
   device to destroy a moving vessel to the satisfaction of the [102]navy
   and President [103]John Tyler. However, opposition from [104]John
   Quincy Adams, who was serving as a [105]U.S. Representative from
   [106]Massachusetts's 8th congressional district, and who personally
   disliked Colt, scuttled the project. After this setback, Colt
   concentrated on manufacturing his waterproof telegraph cable, believing
   the business would boom alongside Morse's invention. He began promoting
   the telegraph companies so he could create a wider market for his
   cable, for which he was to be paid $50 per mile.

[[107]edit] The return of the revolver

   Samuel Hamilton Walker (1817–1847)

   In 1847, [108]Captain Samuel Walker and the [109]Texas Rangers, who had
   acquired some of the first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole
   War, ordered an additional 1,000 revolvers to use in the
   [110]Mexican-American War. The large order allowed Colt to re-establish
   his firearm business. Because he no longer owned a firearm factory, or
   even a model of a firearm, Colt hired [111]Eli Whitney Blake, who was
   established in the arms business, to make his guns. Colt and Captain
   Walker drew up a new improved model from which Whitney produced the
   first thousand-piece order. The company then received an order for a
   thousand more; Colt took a share of the profits at $10 per pistol for
   both orders. He later built the Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing
   Company factory at [112]Hartford, [113]Connecticut. His
   revolving-breech pistol became so popular that the word "Colt" was
   sometimes used as a generic term for the revolver. The [114]California
   gold rush and [115]western expansion made the firearm business boom so
   much that Colt had to expand the Hartford factory repeatedly.

   During this period Colt received an extension on his patent because he
   did not collect on it in the early years. When someone^[[116]who?]
   infringed on the patent, Colt sued and the court ordered that Colt
   receive [117]royalties on each gun that had been sold by the rival
   company. This caused the rival to go out of business. With a virtual
   monopoly, Colt began to sell his pistols in [118]Europe, where demand
   was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation
   that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large
   orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the [119]arms
   race^[[120]citation needed].

[[121]edit] Later years

   Colt later purchased a large tract of land beside the [122]Connecticut
   River, where he built a larger factory called the [123]Colt Armory, a
   [124]manor that he called [125]Armsmear, and employee housing. He
   established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in
   the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak
   Hall, a club where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and
   discussion rooms. On June 5, 1856, Colt married Elizabeth Jarvis, the
   daughter of the Reverend William Jarvis, who lived just downriver from
   Hartford.
   Colt Model 1855 Carbine

   At the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War, Colt—who had called himself
   "Colonel"—was actually commissioned a Colonel by the state of
   Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles
   of Connecticut armed with the [126]Colt revolving rifle. However the
   unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.
   Samuel Colt died in Hartford in 1862 and was buried in [127]Cedar Hill
   Cemetery. At the time of his death, Colt's estate, which he left to his
   wife and son, was estimated to be valued at around $15,000,000. His
   professional responsibilities were turned over to his brother-in-law,
   Richard Jarvis.
