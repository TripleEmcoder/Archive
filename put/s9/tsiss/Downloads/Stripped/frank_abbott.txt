   This article is about the dentist. For the American classical scholar,
   see [7]Frank Frost Abbott.

   Frank Abbott (September 5, 1836 – April 20, 1897) was president of the
   [8]American Dental Association (1888), president of the National
   Association of Dental Faculties (1895), a renowned [9]dentist, an
   author on dental subjects, and an [10]inventor of dental instruments
   such as various types of chisels, pluggers, excavators and scalers,
   some of which are still in use in the 21st century.

[[16]edit] Background

   Born to a transplanted [17]English family, he attended local schools in
   [18]York County, Maine and farmed in [19]Shapleigh, [20]Maine until the
   age of 16, when he began to travel. Beginning in 1855, he studied
   dentistry under Dr. J.E. Ostrander in [21]Oneida, New York. At the age
   of 22 he opened his own dental practice in [22]Johnstown, New York, and
   married Catherine Ann Cuyler, with whom he would have three children.

   Upon the outbreak of the [23]American Civil War, he served as a
   [24]lieutenant of the [25]115th New York Volunteer Infantry, and was
   captured at [26]Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. He returned as a part of
   a prisoner exchange.

[[27]edit] Dental career

   After the civil war he returned to his practice. A year later he
   [28]matriculated as a medical student at the [29]City University of New
   York. While there he was appointed as clinical [30]lecturer in [31]New
   York College of Dentistry (1866), as Professor of Operative Dentistry
   (1868) and as [32]dean, (1869).

   From 1894 - 1895 he failed in attempts to have the [33]trustees there
   establish a Chair of [34]Pathology and [35]Bacteriology (with his son
   as incumbent) and to have the [36]University of New York regents
   replace an act of incorporation of the college with a new
   regent-approved charter.^[[37]citation needed]

   Other subsequent initiatives of his also later failed. In addition to
   the invented dental instruments mentioned above, he also invented the
   first authomatic [38]mallet with an effective back-action. He also
   collected rare American history prints.^[[39]citation needed]
