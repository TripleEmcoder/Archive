   George Ashley Campbell (November 27, 1870 – November 10, 1954) was a
   pioneer in developing and applying quantitative mathematical methods to
   the problems of long-distance telegraphy and telephony. His most
   important contributions were to the theory and implementation of the
   use of [18]loading coils and the first [19]wave filters designed to
   what was to become known as the [20]image method. Both these areas of
   work resulted in important economic advantages for the [21]American
   Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

[[35]edit] Education

   He graduated from [36]MIT in 1891, and then received a master’s degree
   from [37]Harvard University in 1893. He was awarded a fellowship which
   enabled him to spend three years on graduate work; one year studying
   advanced mathematics under [38]Felix Klein at [39]Göttingen, one year
   studying electricity and mechanics under [40]Ludwig Boltzmann in
   Vienna, and one year studying under [41]Henri Poincaré in Paris.
   Campbell received a doctorate from Harvard in 1901 with his
   dissertation being on the subject of his [42]loading coil research at
   [43]AT&T.^[44][1]

[[45]edit] Work on loading coils

   In 1897 Campbell went to work for AT&T in Boston. He developed a method
   for transmitting analog telephony over much greater distances than had
   previously been possible by the insertion of [46]loading coils into the
   line at carefully calculated intervals to increase the [47]inductance.
   Engineer [48]Michael I. Pupin also patented a similar system and AT&T
   paid Pupin a very large sum for his patents, so that development would
   continue without a legal battle. In fact, neither man was the first to
   suggest the idea of loading coils, that credit goes to [49]Oliver
   Heaviside in a 1887 article.^[50][2] Heaviside, however, never patented
   the idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his
   brilliant work.^[51][3] Despite the rather arcane legal arguments
   surrounding this, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to
   actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils.^[52][4]

   Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the [53]Heaviside
   condition,^[54][5] in which the specification for distortionless
   transmission of signals is formulated, but apparently was not aware of
   Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to force a line to meet
   it. Campbell initially attacked the problem from a completely different
   basis. Campbell was tasked by AT&T to investigate the possibility of
   improving line quality with the use of iron-copper bimetallic cable
   invented by [55]John S. Stone,^[56][6] another AT&T engineer. This
   cable of Stone's would similarly increase line inductance and had the
   potential to meet the Heaviside condition. However, Campbell was
   struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone
   route with the budget he had been allocated. After considering that his
   artificial line simulators used [57]lumped components rather than the
   [58]distributed quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he
   could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using
   Stone's distributed line. When his calculations showed that the
   manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be
   able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having
   to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new
   plan.^[59][7] The very first demonstration of loading coils on a
   telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh
   cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been
   used for testing in Pittsburgh) on September 6, 1899 carried out by
   Campbell himself and his assistant.^[60][8] The first telephone cable
   using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plains
   and West Newton in Boston on May 18, 1900.^[61][9]

[[62]edit] Legal battle

   AT&T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim. Pupin was first
   to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations
   before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899),^[63][10]
   Campbell's delay in filing being due to the slow internal machinations
   of AT&T.^[64][11] The claim Pupin makes in his autobiography^[65][12]
   that he had previously thought of the idea while climbing a mountain in
   1894^[66][13]^[67][14] is widely doubted^[68][15]^[69][16]^[70][17] and
   there is no evidence for this either documentary or in the subsequent
   activities of Pupin and his students. However, AT&T foolishly deleted
   from Campbell's proposed patent application all the tables and graphs
   detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before
   the patent was submitted.^[71][18] Since Pupin's patent contained a
   (less accurate) formula, AT&T was open to claims of incomplete
   disclosure. Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end
   with the invention being declared unpatentable, they decided to buy an
   option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT&T would control
   both patents. By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 and by 1917,
   when the AT&T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a
   total of $455,000.^[72][19]

   The invention was of enormous value to AT&T. Telephone cables could now
   be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a
   cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the
   same distance. When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead
   with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood
   to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey
   alone.^[73][20] It has been estimated that AT&T saved $100 million in
   the first quarter of the 20th century.^[74][21]^[75][22] Heaviside, who
   began it all, came away with nothing. He was offered a token payment
   but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work. He remarked
   ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would
   "interfere . . . with the flow of dollars in the proper direction . .
   .".^[76][23]

[[77]edit] Work on filters

   One of the important results of the work on loading coils was that the
   loading caused a cut-off at a definite [78]frequency in the line
   response, whose value could be predicted with a knowledge of the line
   [79]capacitance and coil [80]inductance. An unloaded line had no such
   behavior, the [81]attenuation simply steadily increased with frequency.
   This behavior, and the [82]lumped element networks being used to create
   artificial lines for test purposes, suggested to Campbell a possible
   [83]topology for a filter with similar characteristics.^[84][24]

   This work on filtering was begun in 1910. Using a [85]ladder network of
   inductors and capacitors in appropriate configurations he produced
   [86]low-pass, [87]high-pass and [88]band-pass filters. These filters
   could be designed to pass frequencies in any specified range and reject
   those in other ranges. This class of filter was later to be dubbed the
   [89]constant k filter by [90]Otto Zobel working for AT&T in New
   York.^[91][25]

   The sharpness of transition from the [92]passband to the [93]stopband,
   and the depth of rejection in the stopband were determined by the
   number of sections in the ladder. If a tighter specification was
   required for the filter, all that was necessary was to add more
   inductors and capacitors to the ladder in exactly the same circuit
   configuration as those for a less stringent specification.^[94][25]

   The purpose of filtering a telephone channel so precisely was that AT&T
   were attempting to use the same wires for many telephone conversations
   simultaneously using the technique of [95]frequency division
   multiplexing (FDM) and it was important for reasons of privacy, as well
   as intelligibility, that there was no [96]crosstalk between the
   channels. Filters were also required to separate out the various
   conversations at the far end of the cable. Initially, a passband of 200
   [97]Hz to 2.5 kHz was used for the voice [98]baseband, but soon the
   [99]International Telecommunication Union (ITU) established the world
   standard of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz with 4 kHz spacing between
   channels.^[100][25]

   These filter designs, which Zobel was later to improve upon, were of
   great economic value to AT&T. The ability to send multiple
   conversations over the same wires resulted in very substantial savings
   in cable installation costs. The modulation system used
   ([101]single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) and the ITU
   standard remained the primary method of telephone service distribution
   until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s
   onwards.^[102][26]
