           Gridley Bryant
   Born 1789
        [7]Scituate, Massachusetts
   Died June 13, 1867(1867-06-13)
        [8]Scituate, Massachusetts

   Gridley Bryant (1789 – June 13, 1867) was an [9]American construction
   [10]engineer who ended up building the first commercial [11]railroad in
   the United States and inventing most of the basic technologies involved
   in it. His son, [12]Gridley James Fox Bryant, was a famous 19th century
   architect and builder.

[[13]edit] Biography

   Bryant invented a portable [14]derrick in 1823 and soon gained a
   reputation for being a master structure builder. He was awarded the
   contract to build the [15]United States Bank in [16]Boston,
   Massachusetts, and the [17]Bunker Hill Monument in [18]Charlestown,
   Massachusetts. In investigating how to move the [19]granite needed for
   these projects from the quarry in [20]Quincy to the work sites, he
   concluded that the best method would be via a railroad, much like that
   of the [21]Liverpool and Manchester Railway which was still in the
   planning stages at the time. A reluctant [22]state legislature granted
   Bryant a charter to build a railroad with Bunker Hill monument director
   [23]Thomas Handasyd Perkins as the principal financier and owner of a
   majority of the shares. Construction began on the [24]Granite Railway,
   one of the [25]first railroads in North America, on April 1, 1826, with
   the first train operating on the railroad on October 7, 1826.

   Since the railroad was essentially new technology, Bryant had to create
   the designs for nearly every aspect of the railroad, including the cars
   (4- and 8-wheel designs), track, switches, wheels, turntable, and load
   transfer equipment. Mr. Bryant utilized similar developments and
   technologies that had already been in use on the railroads in England,
   but he modified his design to allow for heavier, more concentrated
   loads and a three-foot frost line. The only real difference between
   Bryant's Granite Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester was in the
   motive power; Bryant used [26]horses and gravity to pull his trains,
   while the Liverpool and Manchester used [27]steam locomotives. Although
   he designed and created all of the machinery, Bryant did not file
   [28]patents on any of his inventions for the railroad. In 1834,
   [29]Ross Winans filed a patent for the eight-wheel car design that
   Bryant had first invented. Bryant was called upon as an expert witness
   by the [30]Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in an effort to invalidate
   Winans' patent.
