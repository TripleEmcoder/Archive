[[24]edit] Biography

   Born in [25]Dawson, Georgia, Jenkins was raised in a suburb about 10
   miles from downtown [26]Atlanta, Georgia. He had a great interest in
   business and technology, particularly with Pete Kight's invention of
   online bill pay; he developed complex software systems such as an audit
   software at age 22, experimenting in his parents basement. Jenkins
   attended Harrison High School in Kennesaw, GA where he graduated there
   in 1997. He received his college education from [27]Kennesaw State
   University, where he studied accounting, economics, and finance. At
   college, Jenkins convinced leading corporations to transmit
   hundreds-of-thousands of records electronically to his proprietary
   electronic audit software, provided that he met security requirements,
   and electronically audited billions of dollars in benefit
   contributions. Not surprisingly, the ability to electronically audit
   billions of dollars in contributions through an independent auditing
   solution caught on. Looking to expand, he hit the road in the hope of
   developing new and improved state-of-the-art solutions for the
   accounting and finance industries.

   After working in various partnerships, and in different fields
   (including [28]finance, [29]accounting, and [30]technology), in 2004 he
   secured the rights of the Personal TaxEdge Software trademarks and
   domains, which were purchased by Intuit Corporation from Bob Parsons
   for $64 million in 1994.^[31][1] He used the intellectual property to
   market his 'TaxEdge' (an automated tax management system) for powering
   [32]tax software. Jenkins began with the provisional patent of "method
   and system for prepopulating tax returns, but finalized his invention
   as the "apparatus for management of taxes." Jenkins produced additional
   patent filings refining the design of his tax management system in the
   coming years and sold systems to several clients. His program is still
   used today in online tax software.^[33][2]

   In 2007, he established FormFree Holdings Corporation, and began
   developing [34]risk management, fraud mitigation, and verification
   systems to address problems which he believed would lead to collapse of
   the U.S. financial system. His first inventions electronically analyzed
   loan applicant bank accounts, in real-time, and generated enhanced
   verification [35]models which lenders would use to accurately predict
   risk of borrowers.

   He has wrote several patents on [36]risk management and credit
   authorization technologies, based on the notion of enhanced credit
   applicant [37]verification and real-time access to financial data. He
   is also a member of the [38]American Bankers Association, Information
   Systems Audit & Control Association, International Foundation of
   Employee Benefit Plans, and the Technology Association of Georgia.
