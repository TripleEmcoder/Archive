[[22]edit] Early years

   Strowger was born in [23]Penfield, near [24]Rochester, [25]New York.
   Little information is available about his early life, but it is known
   that he was the grandson of the second settler and first miller in
   Penfield. In her history of the Town of Penfield, Katherine Thompson
   reports that if his mother gave her children a task, he and his
   brothers would spend most of their time figuring out a machine that
   would do the task for them. He taught school in Penfield for a time,
   and served in the 8th New York Volunteer Cavalry during the
   [26]American Civil War. It is believed that he fought in the [27]Second
   Battle of Bull Run near [28]Manassas, Virginia.

   After the Civil War, it appears he first became a country school
   teacher before he became an [29]undertaker. He is variously attributed
   as living in [30]El Dorado, Kansas or [31]Topeka, Kansas, and finally
   [32]Kansas City, Missouri. It is not clear where his idea of an
   automatic telephone exchange was originally conceived, but his patent
   application identifies him as being a resident of Kansas City, Missouri
   on March 10, 1891.

[[33]edit] Rotary dialing

   Main article: [34]Strowger switch

   Convinced that it should be subscribers, rather than the operator, who
   chose who was called - anecdotally, Strowger's undertaking business was
   losing clients to a competitor whose telephone-operator wife was
   intercepting and redirecting everyone who called Strowger - he first
   conceived his invention in 1888, and patented the [35]automatic
   telephone exchange in 1891. It is reported that he initially
   constructed a model of his invention from a round collar box and some
   straight pins.

[[36]edit] Finances

   While he may have come up with the idea, he was not alone in his
   endeavours and sought the assistance of his nephew William and others
   with a knowledge of electricity and money to realise his concepts. With
   this help the [37]Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company was
   formed and it installed and opened the first commercial exchange in
   (his then home town of) [38]La Porte, Indiana on November 3, 1892, with
   about 75 subscribers and capacity for 99. He married Susan A.
   (1846–1921) from [39]Massachusetts in 1897 as his second wife. Strowger
   sold his patents to his associates in 1896 for $1,800 and sold his
   share in the [40]Automatic Electric Company for $10,000 in 1898. His
   patents subsequently sold to Bell Systems for $2.5 million in 1916.

   The company's engineers continued development of Strowger's designs and
   submitted several patents in the names of its employees. It also
   underwent several name changes. Strowger himself seems to have not
   taken part in this further development. He subsequently moved to
   [41]St. Petersburg, Florida and appears to have returned to being an
   undertaker, as H.P. Bussey Funeral Home records report an unidentified
   body being moved "for Mr. Strowger" in December 1899. The same funeral
   home subsequently buried Strowger himself. Strowger was a man of some
   wealth at his death and was reported as owning at least a city block of
   property.

[[42]edit] Death

   He died, aged 62, of an [43]aneurysm after suffering from [44]anemia,
   at [45]St. Petersburg, [46]Pinellas County, Florida and was buried in
   [47]Greenwood Cemetery the next day. His grave is marked with the
   traditional white [48]headstone with an inscription that reads: "Lieut.
   A.B. Strowger, Co. A, 8 NY Cav."

[[49]edit] Widow

   He was survived by his widow Susan A. Strowger (1846–1921). After her
   death in [50]Tampa, Florida, on April 14, 1921, her obituary appeared
   in the [51]St. Petersburg Times, claiming she had additional
   "revolutionary" Strowger designs, but she had refused to make them
   public while she was alive because only others would profit from her
   husband's designs. She had claimed that her husband had only received
   $10,000 for his invention, when he should have received a million.

[[52]edit] Legacy

   A bronze plaque, to commemorate his invention, was placed on his grave
   in 1945 by telephone company officials. Strowger was admitted to the
   hall of fame of the U.S. Independent Telephone Association (now called
   the USTA) in 1965. Apart from his invention, his name has also been
   given to a [53]locomotive and a company business award.

   In 2003, the Verizon Foundation awarded $4500 to Pinellas Heritage,
   Inc. and the Pinellas Genealogy Society in Strowger's memory. The funds
   were used to develop a website to impart the history of the cemetery
   where Strowger is buried, and to restore two Civil War memorials. The
   Greenwood Cemetery project won an organization achievement award from
   the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.
