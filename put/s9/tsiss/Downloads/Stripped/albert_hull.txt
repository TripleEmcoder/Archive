[[24]edit] Education and early career

   Albert Wallace Hull was born on a farm in [25]Southington,
   [26]Connecticut. He was the son of Francis and Lewis Hull. He was the
   second oldest of 9 brothers, and had an older sister. Despite rural
   poverty all the brothers completed college, and two others, Thomas and
   Daniel also pursued lives devoted to science --- medicine and chemistry
   respectively.

   He majored in [27]Greek and after taking one undergraduate course in
   [28]physics, graduated from [29]Yale University. He taught languages at
   [30]The Albany Academy before returning to Yale, to take a doctorate in
   physics. He then undertook research on [31]photoelectricity whilst
   teaching physics for five years at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

[[32]edit] Industry

   In 1914 Hull joined the [33]General Electric Research Laboratory (GERL)
   in [34]Schenectady, [35]New York and remained there until his
   retirement in 1949.

[[36]edit] Experimental work

   During 1916, Hull began investigation into the use of magnetic control
   of [37]thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) as an alternative to grid or
   electrostatic control and he had tested successfully magnetic control
   by applying a magnetic field parallel to the axis of the tube.

   Initially, Hull's work on these novel electron tubes was part of an
   effort at General Electric to develop amplifiers and oscillators that
   might be used to circumvent the vacuum- tube triode patents of Lee de
   Forest and Edwin Armstrong.

[[38]edit] Dynatron

   He invented the [39]dynatron which had three electrodes: a thermionic
   cathode, a perforated anode, and a supplementary anode or plate. In
   normal operation the supplementary anode was maintained at a lower
   positive voltage than the perforated anode. The secondary emission of
   electrons from the plate made the dynatron behave as a true negative
   resistance and so the tube could generate oscillations over a wide
   range of frequencies or be used as an amplifier. When a control grid
   was added between the cathode and the perforated anode, the device was
   called a "pliodynatron."

[[40]edit] Magnetron

   By 1920 his research led to his invention of the [41]magnetron.^[42][1]
   This took the form of a [43]coaxial cylindrical anode and cathode with
   an [44]axial magnetic field produced by an external coil. The Hull
   magnetron was tested as an amplifier in radio receivers and also as a
   low-frequency oscillator. It was reported in 1925 that a magnetron made
   at GERL could generate a power of 15 kW at a frequency of 20 kHz. At
   the time Hull anticipated that the magnetron would find greater use as
   a power converter than in communication applications.

   The Magnetron was later used by Percy Spencer to create the microwave
   and the British military to create radar.

[[45]edit] Gas-filled electron tubes

   During the 1920s, Hull also was a major contributor to the development
   of gas-filled electron tubes at the GERL. He discovered how to protect
   thermionic cathodes from rapid disintegration under ion bombardment.
   This discovery enabled the successful development of hot-cathode
   [46]thyratrons (gaseous triodes) and [47]phanotrons (gaseous diodes).

[[48]edit] Publications

   In the 1918 issue of the [49]Proceedings of the IRE he published a
   paper on the [50]dynatron vacuum tube which he had invented.

[[51]edit] Career promotion

   Hull was promoted to assistant director of the GERL in 1928 and was
   known for his collegial management style with minimal interference with
   the research agenda of his staff members.

[[52]edit] Awards

   He was awarded the 1924 [53]Howard N. Potts Medal of the [54]Franklin
   Institute.

   He was awarded the 1930 [55]IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award and
   the [56]IRE Medal of Honor in 1958 by the [57]Institute of Radio
   Engineers (IRE) "For outstanding scientific achievement and pioneering
   inventions and development in the field of electron tubes."

   He did consulting work and served on an advisory committee of the Army
   Ballistics Research Laboratories after retirement from General Electric
   and was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He also
   served as president of the American Physical Society in 1942.

   He died on 22 January 1966 at the age of 85.
