   Lucien Stephen Crandall (May 4, 1844 - 19??) was an [10]American
   [11]inventor of [12]typewriters, [13]adding machines and electrical
   devices. Crandall gave his name to several typewriters, and he was also
   involved in the development of various machines, such as the project to
   produce the Hammond design at the Remington factory, or later the
   International typewriter.

[[23]edit] Early life

   Born in Portlerane, [24]Broome County, New York, Crandall was a
   descendant on his mother's side of [25]Joseph Warren. He served as a
   private for three years during the [26]American Civil War, surviving
   twelve major battles without injury.

[[27]edit] Career

   In 1873 Crandall was employed as a salesman by James Densmore and
   George W. Yost of New York. Densmore and Yost had licenced
   [28]Christopher Sholes and [29]Carlos Glidden's patents and had
   established a contract with [30]E. Remington and Sons to manufacture
   them. They gave Crandall the necessary tools and set him to work to
   perfect the typewriter. Crandall soon worked out an oscillating typebar
   which he obtained a patent for; this prints capital and lowercase
   characters by shifting the platen, and was later used in Remington
   typewriters.

   Crandall assigned half of his patent to Densmore and Yost. After
   leaving the company and inventing his own typewriter, he started
   negotiations with E. Remington and Sons for the sale of the other half
   of his patent. Densmore learned of this, and wrote a letter to
   Remington denouncing Crandall as a "liar, scoundrel, a dishonest and
   immoral man". Crandall then brought an action against Densmore for
   defamation of character, claiming $100,000 in damages, saying that the
   letter had caused his negotiations with Remington to fail. Densmore's
   defense was that the charges made in his letter were all true.^[31][1]

   In 1875 Crandall received a patent for a typewriter for blind users and
   in 1879 was granted a patent for a downstrike typesleeve machine, much
   like the one that he introduced in 1884 and set up the Crandall
   Typewriting Company.

[[32]edit] Typewriters

[[33]edit] The Crandall Typewriter

   The Crandall Typewriter was patented in 1881 and manufactured by the
   Crandall Machine Company of [34]Groton, New York. The Crandall used a
   type sleeve, as opposed to typebars, inked by a ribbon. It also used a
   non standard two-row keyboard. It has been called "the first American
   visible and practically useful typewriter."

   The type sleeve, which could easily be swapped out, had six rows of
   characters and was mounted obliquely on the first model. A key press
   rotated rotated it and moved it along its axis to select the
   corresponding letter, bringing it down to the platen and locking it by
   temporarily engaging a pin in a hole.^[35][2]

   The typist shifted to capitals with the "CAPS" key, which raised the
   type cylinder by two rows; the "F&P" key raised the cylinder by four
   rows, and was used for typing figures and punctuation. The lever
   between these two keys served as a shift lock; by pushing it backwards,
   one could type in capitals only. One special feature was that the
   period and comma each had their own key, and can always be typed
   regardless of the shift.

[[36]edit] New Model

   A reworked machine named the New Model appeared in 1885. It was
   produced in Groton from 1887, and sold in Europe from 1886 onwards by
   an agent in [37]Amsterdam. The most significant changes from the
   previous machine were the slightly curved, two-row keyboard with 28
   keys, and the vertical type cylinder which had 6 rows of 14 characters.

   Later examples of this model were ornately decorated with inlaid
   [38]mother of pearl, painted roses and gold scrollwork, one of the most
   extravagantly decorated typewriters ever manufactured. Collectors often
   call the New Model Crandall the most beautiful of all typewriters. This
   reputation is fully justified by the somewhat overdone yet elegant
   effect of the painted flowers with inlaid [39]mother-of-pearl above the
   keyboard, the filigreed golden pinstripes, and the flower motifs that
   are found even on the back of the frame.^[40][3]

[[41]edit] Universal Crandall No. 3

   This model was first marketed in 1893, and was built on the same
   principles as the New Model. It added a straight three-row QWERTY
   keyboard, and as Model No. 4 it also offered a two-color ribbon. The
   elaborate decorations had by now given way to a comparatively sober
   design.

[[42]edit] Improved Crandall

   The Improved Crandall of 1895 was completely different from the
   previous machines, and it is debatable whether it ever entered
   production.
