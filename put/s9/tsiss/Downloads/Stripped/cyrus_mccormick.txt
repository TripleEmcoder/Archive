   Cyrus Hall McCormick, Sr. (1809–1884) was an [18]American [19]inventor
   and founder of the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, which became
   part of [20]International Harvester Company in 1902.^[21][1] He and
   many members of the [22]McCormick family became prominent
   [23]Chicagoans. Although McCormick is often called the "inventor" of
   the mechanical reaper, it was based on work by others, including his
   family members.

[[34]edit] Early life

   Cyrus Hall McCormick was born February 15, 1809 on the McCormick family
   farm known as [35]Walnut Grove in [36]Rockbridge County, Virginia, in
   the [37]Shenandoah Valley on the western side of the [38]Blue Ridge
   Mountains. His parents were [39]Robert McCormick (1780–1846) and Mary
   Ann Hall McCormick (1780–1853),^[40][2] both of whom were of
   [41]Scots-Irish descent.^[42][3]^:17 He was the oldest of eight
   children, and had little or no formal education.^[43][4]

   Although the plantation kept some slaves, every family member was
   expected to help during harvest. From a young age, McCormick preferred
   using machines to save work in the fields. In his teens he devised a
   [44]scythe cradle, and then patented [45]plows that could be used on
   hillsides and sharpened themselves. His father kept a workshop to
   repair and build machines, such as those for mills on the property.
   McCormick tried to sell a hemp brake machine to farmers in [46]Kentucky
   but made no sales.^[47][4]

[[48]edit] Reaper

   McCormick's father had obtained a few patents of his own, and worked
   for 28 years on a horse-drawn mechanical [49]reaper to harvest grain.
   However, he was not able to build a reliable version and his son took
   up the project.^[50][2] A few machines based on a design of [51]Patrick
   Bell in Scotland (which had not been patented) were available in the
   US. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. The McCormick design was
   pulled and cut the grain to one side. One of the first public
   demonstrations by McCormick of mechanical reaping was at the nearby
   village of [52]Steeles Tavern, Virginia in 1831. McCormick claimed he
   developed a final version of the reaper in 18 months. The young
   McCormick was granted a patent on the reaper on June 21, 1834.^[53][4]

   This machine also did not work in many conditions, so none were sold.
   Instead, the McCormick family worked on starting a metal smelting
   business. The [54]panic of 1837 almost caused the family to go into
   bankruptcy when a partner pulled out. In 1839 he started doing public
   demonstrations of the reaper, but local farmers still thought the
   machine was not reliable. He did sell one in 1840, but none for 1841.
   Using the endorsement of his first customer, and continuously improving
   the design, seven reapers were sold in 1842, 29 in 1843, and 50 in
   1844. They were all built manually in the family farm shop. He received
   a second patent for reaper improvements on January 31, 1845.^[55][4]

[[56]edit] A new city

   Word kept spreading, and McCormick noticed orders were coming from
   farther west, where farms tended to be larger. While he was in
   [57]Washington, DC to get his 1845 patent, he heard about a factory in
   [58]Brockport, New York, where he contracted to have the machines
   mass-produced. In 1847 he and his brother [59]Leander J. McCormick
   moved to [60]Chicago, where they established a factory to build their
   machines. At the time, other cities in the [61]midwestern United States
   such as [62]Cleveland, Ohio, [63]St. Louis, Missouri, or [64]Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin were more prosperous. Chicago had no paved streets. However,
   Chicago offered water transportation from the east over the [65]Great
   Lakes for his raw materials, as well as railroad connections to the
   farther west where his customers would be.^[66][3]

   When McCormick tried to renew his patent in 1848, the [67]US Patent
   Office noted that a very similar machine had already been patented by
   [68]Obed Hussey a few months earlier. McCormick then claimed he had
   really invented it in 1831, but the renewal was denied.^[69][5] Another
   reaper patent had already been issued to William Manning of
   [70]Plainfield, New Jersey in May 1831, but Manning was evidently not
   defending his patent.^[71][4]

   Brother [72]William Sanderson McCormick moved to Chicago in 1849, and
   joined the company to take care of financial affairs. The McCormick
   reaper sold well, partially as a result of savvy and innovative
   business practices.^[73][2] Their products came onto the market just as
   the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant
   markets. He developed marketing and sales techniques, developing a vast
   network of trained salesmen able to demonstrate operation of the
   machines in the field. [74]William H. Seward said of McCormick's
   invention that owing to it "the line of civilization moves westward
   thirty miles each year."^[[75]citation needed] A company advertisement
   was a take-off of the [76]Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way
   mural by [77]Emanuel Leutze adding to the title: “with McCormick
   Reapers in the Van."^[78][6]

   In 1851, McCormick traveled to [79]London to display a reaper at the
   [80]Crystal Palace Exhibition. He won a gold medal, but celebration was
   short-lived when he learned that he had lost a court challenge to
   Hussey's patent.^[81][7]

[[82]edit] McCormick-Manny Case

   Another McCormick company competitor was the company of [83]John Henry
   Manny of [84]Rockford, Illinois. After the [85]Manny Reaper beat the
   McCormick reaper at the [86]Paris Exposition of 1855, McCormick filed a
   lawsuit against Manny for patent infringement.^[87][8]

   McCormick demanded that Manny stop producing reapers, and pay McCormick
   $400,000. The trial, originally scheduled for [88]Chicago, Illinois in
   September 1855, had prominent lawyers on both sides. McCormick hired
   former US Attorney General [89]Reverdy Johnson and [90]New York patent
   attorney [91]Edward Nicholl Dickerson. Manny hired [92]Edwin M. Stanton
   who hired local Illinois lawyer [93]Abraham Lincoln. However, the trial
   was moved to [94]Cincinnati, Ohio. Although Manny won the case, with an
   opinion by Supreme Court Judge [95]John McLean,^[96][9] Lincoln ended
   up not contributing to the defense. After later being elected
   President, Lincoln chose Stanton as his [97]Secretary of War.^[98][10]

[[99]edit] More controversey and success

   In 1861, after Hussey's patent was extended but McCormick's was not, he
   convinced the US Congress to step in.^[100][11]

   In 1879 his brother Leander changed the name of the company from "Cyrus
   H. McCormick and Brothers" to "McCormick Harvesting Machine
   Company".^[102][12] Leander wanted to clearly acknowledge contributions
   of others to the reaper "invention", especially their father. Cyrus'
   work was done with the help of Jo Anderson, a slave on the plantation
   at the time.^[103][13]

[[104]edit] Death and legacy

   McCormick died in Chicago on May 13, 1884; he had been handicapped for
   the last four years of his life.^[105][14] The official leadership of
   the company passed on to his son [106]Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr. He was
   buried in [107]Graceland Cemetery.^[108][15] The McCormick factories
   were later the site of urban labor strikes that led to the
   [109]Haymarket Square riot in 1886.

   Cyrus McCormick's papers are held by the [110]Wisconsin Historical
   Society.^[111][1] Numerous prizes and medals were awarded for his
   reaper, and he was elected a corresponding member of the [112]French
   Academy of Sciences, "as having done more for the cause of agriculture
   than any other living man." The invention of the reaper made farming
   far more efficient, and resulted in a global shift of labor from
   farmlands to cities.

   A statue of McCormick is on the front campus of [113]Washington and Lee
   University, [114]Lexington, Virginia.

   The town of [115]McCormick, South Carolina and [116]McCormick County
   were named for him after he bought a gold mine in the town, formerly
   known as Dornsville.^[117][16]

   McCormick was inducted into the [118]Junior Achievement U.S. Business
   Hall of Fame in 1975.^[119][17]

[[120]edit] Family tree

   On January 26, 1858 he married [121]Nancy Fowler (1835–1923), better
   known as "Nettie".^[122][18] They had seven children:
    1. [123]Cyrus Hall McCormick Jr. was born May 16, 1859.
    2. Mary Virginia McCormick was born May 5, 1861.^[124][18]
    3. Anita McCormick was born July 4, 1866, married Emmons Blaine on
       September 26, 1889, and died February 12, 1954. Her husband was the
       oldest son of US Secretary of State [125]James G. Blaine.^[126][19]
    4. Alice McCormick was born March 15, 1870 and died less than a year
       later on January 25, 1871.^[127][18]
    5. [128]Harold Fowler McCormick was born May 2, 1872, married and died
       in 1941.
    6. Stanley Robert McCormick was born November 2, 1874, married
       [129]Katharine Dexter (1875–1967), and died January 19, 1947.

   Mary Virginia and Stanley Robert both suffered from
   [130]schizophrenia.^[131][20] Stanley's life was dramatized in the 1998
   novel [132]Riven Rock by [133]T. Coraghessan Boyle.^[134][21]

   He was the uncle of [135]Robert Sanderson McCormick (son-in-law of
   [136]Joseph Medill); granduncle of [137]Joseph Medill McCormick and
   [138]Robert Rutherford McCormick; great-granduncle of [139]William
   McCormick Blair, Jr.^[140][18]
