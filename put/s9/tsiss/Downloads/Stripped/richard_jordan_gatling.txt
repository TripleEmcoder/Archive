[[18]edit] Life

   Gatling was born in the town of [19]Como, North Carolina in
   [20]Hertford County. Being the son of a farmer and inventor, Gatling
   distinguished himself as an inventor. In 1839, when he was 21 years
   old, Gatling created a screw propeller for steamboats, unknown to him
   that a screw propeller had been patented just months prior to Gatling’s
   invention by [21]John Ericsson.^[22][1]^[23][2] While living in North
   Carolina, he worked in the county clerk’s office, taught school
   briefly, and became a merchant. At the age of 36, Gatling moved to
   [24]St. Louis, [25]Missouri where he worked in a dry goods store and
   invented a rice-sowing machine and a wheat drill (machines to aid in
   planting rice and wheat, respectively).^[26][3] The introduction of
   these machines did much to revolutionize the agricultural system in the
   country.^[27][4]

   After an attack of [28]smallpox, Gatling became interested in medicine.
   He graduated from the [29]Ohio Medical College in 1850 with an [30]MD.
   Although he had his MD, he never practiced; he was more interested in a
   career as an inventor.^[31][1]^[32][4]

   At the outbreak of the [33]Civil War, Gatling was living in
   [34]Indianapolis, [35]Indiana. There he devoted himself to the
   perfection of firearms. In [36]1861, the same year the war started,
   Gatling invented the [37]Gatling Gun.^[38][1] A year later, he founded
   the Gatling Gun Company.

   By the early 1850s, Gatling was successful enough in business to offer
   marriage to Jemima Sanders, 19 years younger than Gatling and the
   daughter of a prominent Indianapolis physician.^[39][5] They married on
   October 25, 1854. Her younger sister Zerelda was married to [40]David
   Wallace, the governor of Indiana. Later in his life, Gatling patented
   inventions to improve toilets, bicycles, steam-cleaning of raw wool,
   pneumatic power, and many other fields. He was elected as the first
   president of the [41]American Association of Inventors and
   Manufacturers in 1891, serving for six years. Although still quite
   wealthy at the time of his death, he had made and lost several fortunes
   in bad investments.

   In his final years, Gatling moved back to St. Louis, Missouri to form a
   new company for manufacturing his steam plows, or tractors. While in
   [42]New York City to visit his daughter and to talk with his patent
   agency, Richard Gatling died at his daughter's home on February 26,
   1903.^[43][6] He is interred at the [44]Crown Hill Cemetery in
   [45]Indianapolis, Indiana.^[46][7]

[[47]edit] Inventions

   While being most known for inventing the [48]Gatling Gun, Gatling
   invented and patented a number of other inventions. His inventions
   include a [49]screw propeller and a wheat drill (a planting device) in
   1839, a hemp break machine in 1850, a steam plow ([50]steam tractor) in
   1857, the Gatling Gun in 1861, a marine steam ram in 1862, and a motor
   driven plow ([51]tractor).^[52][3]

[[53]edit] The Gatling Gun

   Main article: [54]Gatling Gun

   Gatling invented the Gatling gun after he noticed that a majority of
   the soldiers fighting in the [55]Civil War were lost to disease rather
   than gunshots. In 1877, he wrote:

     It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine – a gun – which
     could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle
     duty as a hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the
     necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and
     disease [would] be greatly diminished.^[56][8]

   The gun was based on Gatling’s seed planter.^[57][9] A working
   prototype was developed in 1861. In 1862, he founded the Gatling Gun
   Company in [58]Indianapolis, Indiana to market the gun. The first 6
   production guns were destroyed during a fire in December 1862 at the
   factory. All 6 of them had been manufactured at Gatling's expense.
   Undaunted, Gatling arranged for another 13 to be manufactured at the
   Cincinnati Type Factory.

   Though the gun was developed during the Civil War, it saw very little
   action. This is partly due to the fact that Gatling was accused of
   being a [59]copperhead because of his [60]North Carolina roots, but
   this was never proven.^[61][10] Gatling was never affiliated with the
   Confederate States government or military, nor did he live in the South
   during the Civil War. {5} Although [62]General Benjamin F. Butler
   bought 12 and [63]Admiral David Dixon Porter bought one,^[64][11] it
   wasn't until 1866 that the US Government officially purchased Gatling
   Guns.^[65][12] In 1870 he sold his patents for the Gatling gun to
   [66]Colt.^[67][13] Gatling remained president of the Gatling Gun
   Company until it was fully absorbed by Colt in 1897.

   The hand-cranked Gatling gun was declared obsolete by the [68]United
   States Army in 1911.^[[69]citation needed]
