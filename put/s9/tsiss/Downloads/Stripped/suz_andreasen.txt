[[26]edit] Early life

   She was born in [27]Iowa, the fourth generation in a family of
   inventors and scientists. Andreasen began her interest in the arts at a
   young age. Her first published work was in the American JAMA, The
   American Medical Journal at the age of 10. She then began her interest
   in [28]metalsmithing alongside her late father [29]George
   Andreasen,^[30][1] the inventor of [31]memory wire who died when Suz
   Andreasen was only 24.

   She has studied music all her life playing many instruments including
   the piano, the trumpet and the guitar. Her vocal studies began at 12
   and continue to this day. She is an avid composer and song writer.

   Andreasen moved to New York at the age of 18. Educated at [32]New York
   University between 1981 and 1984, she went on to [33]apprentice from
   1986 to 1991 by studying the renderings of [34]Fulco di Verdura, an
   acclaimed Italian designer of the 1940s. Her work has been featured in
   many books on jewelry design, and her collection is referenced in
   dozens of published titles.

[[35]edit] Jewelry

   Suz Andreasen's Tigerlily Suite

   She is known for craftsmanship and [36]jewelry design in 22 [37]carat
   [38]gold, her brand Women Want Jewelry, which she launched in 1999, and
   her use of rare [39]gemstones, before launching her own signature line
   Suz Andreasen American Couture Jewelry in [40]New York. She has
   received many award, sited for her work including the Society of North
   American Goldsmith's "Golden Opportunity", exhibition along with
   Ethical Metalsmiths^[41][2] and the American Craft Council's
   prestigious Mentor Program award. She is a member of the [42]American
   Craft Council, founded in 1943 by Aileen Osborn Webb.

   Her work is [43]expressionist in both form and content, influenced by
   the work of the late [44]Dorrie Nossiter an English designer from the
   Arts and Crafts movement. Andreasen constructs her work 22 carat gold
   using traditional milling and fabricating techniques. She uses
   patterning and alloy stains to contrast gold with gemstones and often
   features textural elements and ancient [45]goldsmithing techniques.
   Andreasen often uses natural as well as tribal forms as her
   inspiration. Her work can be found in [46]Saks Fifth Avenue, in New
   York City. During 2007, her work has been featured in National Jeweler
   Magazine, Art Jewelry Magazine, Jewellery International, Vioro,
   Rappaport Diamond Report, Inside Weddings, Colored Stone Magazine and
   American Style Magazine.

   Andreasen is the founder, along with other notable experts, of [47]The
   Couture Awards. She founded the awards to explore new frontiers in
   jewelry design, believing there was a demand for an award based on
   artistic merit alone. The award was held on December 7, 2007 and
   featured 44 jewelry designers from 20 states throughout the U.S. A book
   was published from this exhibition entitled American Couture Jewelry.

[[48]edit] Awards

   Before her career as a jewelry designer, Andreasen was well known as a
   backup singer for Elton John. Her first CD release, "Angels of Mercy"
   earned her a grammy nomination in 1993. She has also published two
   books, "Dreaming The Future," 1997 and "American Couture Jewelry,"
   2007.

   Andreasen has won many awards including the Craft Council Mentor Award,
   the Spectrum Award Finalist in 2007 and 2008 and on April 29, 2007,
   Andreasen was awarded first place in the American Bench Jewelers
   Passion Awards^[49][3] for her "Tigerlilly" necklace. In 2007,
   Andreasen exhibited at Couture 2007 at the [50]Wynn Las Vegas and at
   the Walters Art Museum in [51]Baltimore, [52]Maryland.

   She is a member of the [53]Society of North American Goldsmiths, SNAG,
   the [54]World Gold Council, the [55]American Gemological Trade
   Association, the [56]Contemporary Design Group and the [57]Jewelers of
   America. Her works can be seen in many museums throughout the world
   including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and the Schmuck
   Museum in Pforxheim Germany.

   Andreasen is currently working on a new book about American Politics
   and her family genealogy which dates back to some of the first American
   immigrant settlers who migrated from Scotland on the Ship Thistle in
   1687, to be entitled "The Crossing"
