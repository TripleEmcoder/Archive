   Hudson Maxim (February 3, 1853 – May 6, 1927), was a U.S. [17]inventor
   and [18]chemist who invented a variety of [19]explosives, including
   [20]smokeless gunpowder. He was the brother of [21]Hiram Stevens Maxim,
   inventor of the [22]Maxim gun and uncle of [23]Hiram Percy Maxim,
   inventor of the Maxim Silencer. He also has a great - great grandson,
   Jeffrey paul maxim.

   Maxim was a man of many talents. He started his career in 1881 as the
   publisher of Real Pen Work - Self Instructor in Penmanship, a book
   addressing the arts of calligraphy and [24]penmanship, and the sale of
   special inks, pens, and other supplies related to penmanship. Later he
   joined his brother [25]Hiram Stevens Maxim's workshop in the United
   Kingdom, where they both worked on the improvement of [26]smokeless
   gunpowder. After some disputes, Hudson Maxim returned to the [27]USA
   and developed a number of stable high explosives, the rights of which
   were sold to the [28]DuPont company.

   During [29]World War I, Maxim wrote a book, "Defenseless America", in
   which he pointed out the inferiority of the American defence system and
   the vulnerability of the country against attacks of foreign aggressors.
   His good friend, [30]Elbert Hubbard, died on the [31]RMS Lusitania when
   it was torpedoed by a German submarine. This event fueled his belief
   that the USA should improve its defenses and join the war against
   Germany on the side of the [32]Entente.

   Maxim also wrote the book "The Science of Poetry and the Philosophy of
   Language" about the nature and writing of [33]poetry. In this work, he
   contended that words, like chemical particles, had natural laws that
   governed the manner in which they could be combined into verse, and
   that poetry perceived as excellent was in fact one that conformed to
   those laws. He also argued that certain famous poets ([34]William
   Shakespeare, [35]William Wordsworth) had discovered those laws and put
   them to use in their poetry.

   During his experimental career, he lost his left hand in a [36]mercury
   fulminate explosion in 1912. Hudson lived out his latter years at his
   estate on the shores of Lake Hopatcong New Jersey. He was a great
   promoter and supporter of the development of Lake Hopatcong and the
   Borough of Hopatcong and is honored by a memorial in Lake Hopatcong
   State Park.

   He was an important member of the College of Fellows of the Academy of
   Nations.
