   Marcel Joseph Vogel (1917–1991) was a research scientist working at the
   [19]IBM [20]San Jose Advanced Systems Development Division Los Gatos
   Lab (actually located in San Jose) for some 27 years. He is sometimes
   referred to as Dr. Vogel, this title was an [21]honorary doctoral
   degree, [22]Ph.D..

   It is claimed that Vogel started his research into [23]luminescence
   while he was still in his teens. This research eventually led him to
   publish his thesis, Luminescence in Liquids and Solids and Their
   Practical Application, in collaboration with [24]Chicago University's
   Dr. Peter Pringsheim in 1943.

   Two years after the publication, Vogel incorporated his own company,
   Vogel Luminescence, in [25]San Francisco. For the next decade the firm
   developed a variety of new products: [26]fluorescent [27]crayons, tags
   for [28]insecticides, a [29]black light inspection kit to determine the
   secret trackways of [30]rodents in cellars from their [31]urine and the
   [32]psychedelic colors popular in "[33]new age" posters. In 1957, Vogel
   Luminescence was sold to Ultra Violet Products and Vogel joined IBM as
   a full-time research scientist.

   He received numerous [34]patents^[[35]citation needed] for his
   inventions. Among these was the magnetic coating for the 24” [36]hard
   disk drive systems still in use. His areas of expertise, besides
   luminescence, were [37]phosphor technology, [38]magnetics and
   [39]liquid crystal systems.

   He also designed the vogel crystal, which allegedly focuses "universal
   life force" by concentrating it to a higher level. Vogel crystals are
   cut to the exact angle of 51 degrees 51 minutes and 51 seconds, the
   exact angle of the [40]Great Pyramid of Giza. The crystal is designed
   after the geometry of the [41]Tree of Life symbol. Its design is said
   to have come to him in a dream.

   Vogel examined a metal sample which was allegedly given to [42]Billy
   Meier by [43]extraterrestrials and marveled at its unusual properties
   (Vogel stated it contained the element [44]thulium)^[[45]citation
   needed]; however, it is worthwhile to note that Vogel was a chemist
   rather than a [46]metallurgist.

   Vogel was featured in the first episode of In Search Of hosted by
   [47]Leonard Nimoy, called "Other Voices". He gave his theories
   regarding the possibility of communication between plants.^[48][1]
