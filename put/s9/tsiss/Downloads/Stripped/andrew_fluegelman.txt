[[24]edit] Early business career

[[25]edit] "Freeware"

   Shortly after the introduction of the [26]IBM PC Fluegelman developed
   [27]PC-Talk, a very popular and successful communications software. He
   marketed it under a system he called "[28]Freeware," which he
   characterized as "an experiment in [29]economics more than
   [30]altruism." Freeware was licensed under terms that encouraged users
   to make voluntary payments for the software, and allowed users to copy
   and redistribute the software freely as long as the license terms and
   text were not altered.

[[31]edit] Magazine editor

   Fluegelman edited [32]PC World magazine from its introduction in 1982
   until 1985, and [33]Macworld magazine from its introduction in 1984
   until 1985.

[[34]edit] Disappearance

   In 1985, Fluegelman, already suffering from [35]colitis, was diagnosed
   with [36]cancer. On the afternoon of July 6, 1985, he left his office
   in [37]Tiburon, California. A week later, his abandoned car was found
   at the north end of the [38]Golden Gate Bridge near [39]San Francisco.
   A memorial service was held for Fluegelman by his family, and he is
   [40]presumed dead, though his body has never been found. Kevin Strehlo,
   then an [41]InfoWorld columnist, submitted a memorial column which
   mentioned that "friends say a [42]suicide note was found inside" his
   car. InfoWorld rejected this column, but an online news service
   published it.^[43][2]

[[44]edit] List of books published by Fluegelman

   A successful book publisher/packager, Andrew created "The Headlands
   Press," which produced the following books and negotiated publishing
   contracts for them with major publishers. Many of the books were
   designed by Howard Jacobsen and produced by his company, Community Type
   and Design. This list is arranged by year of book publication:

       as being from NEWSBYTES (dated 7/30/85), an electronic publication
       available on [67]The Source. NEWSBYTES says that it is the full
       text of an InfoWorld article that led to Strehlo's resignation from
       that publication "because the editors saw the last few paragraphs
       unfit for publication." Article says in part "Fluegelman had been
       missing for about a week when his car was found parked near the
       toll plaza on the Marin County side of the Golden Gate Bridge, the
       site of so many of his moments of inspiration. Friends say a
       suicide note was found inside. His family held a memorial service
       in New York the following Sunday. Yet, as this is being written, no
       body has been found. Police still list Fluegelman as a missing
       person."
