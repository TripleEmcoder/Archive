[[25]edit] Early life

   Davidson was born in [26]Somerville, New Jersey on October 9, 1870. His
   early basic education was in a country public school.^[27][3]

[[28]edit] Mid life

   Davidson attended the [29]Massachusetts Agricultural College and the
   [30]University of Wisconsin.^[31][1] He also attended [32]Northwestern
   Military and Naval Academy and graduated from there in 1889.^[33][4]

[[34]edit] Northwestern Military Academy

   Davidson was [35]commandant of Northwestern Military and Naval Academy
   from 1892 to 1912. He was its secretary and treasurer from 1912 to
   1914. Davidson was their [36]superintendent and president from 1914 to
   1935. His father [37]Harlan Page Davidson started the Academy.^[38][5]

[[39]edit] Notability

[[40]edit] Bicycle Corp

   Davidson organized the first military Bicycle Corps in 1894. It
   consisted of cadets from the Northwestern Military Academy.^[41][6]
   Davidson developed the military bicycle corps in the hope that the
   bicycle would speed up the movement of troops. Davidson staged a
   cross-country 850 mile expedition to Washington, D.C in the summer of
   1897. The maneuvers were done in a military practice as if the Bicycle
   Corps were traveling in enemy territory.^[42][7] The expedition took 15
   days and had much national publicity. Davidson offered the government
   the services of his Bicycle Corps when the [43]Spanish-American War
   broke out.^[44][8] He was turned down since the military bicycles had
   minimum firepower and showed it left the bicycle-rider exposed to
   retaliation. The new automobile that was being innovated at the time
   showed better combat possibilities, if it could be properly armed and
   protected against enemy firepower.^[45][7]

[[46]edit] Armored cars

   Davidson was the leading pioneer of armored military vehicles in the
   United States starting in 1898.^[47][9] He is described as the inventor
   of the first military vehicle in United States.^[48][10] He made a
   three-wheeled automobile armed with a [49]gun carriage in 1899. There
   were many newspaper articles at the time with imaginative stories and
   drawings of Davidson's military vehicle. Davidson's gasoline military
   vehicle was much simpler than their futuristic drawings.^[50][7] Later
   it was developed into the [51]Automobile Battery armored car.^[52][8]
   Today's historians can trace the lineage of the [53]Bradley Fighting
   Vehicle back to Davidson's vehicles.^[54][11] Davidson is considered
   "The Father of American armored cars."^[55][12]

   Davidson contributed to various journals that were associated with the
   military and science.^[56][2] He was an inventor of various military
   equipment, including a military vehicle radio.^[57][4] He even designed
   the first field hospital automobile with X-ray equipment.^[58][13]

[[59]edit] Fraternities and clubs

   Davidson was associated with the Delta Union and the Delta Upilon
   Fraternity.^[60][2] He was also a member of the Pines Crest Lakes Club
   of Avon Park, Florida; Union League Club of Chicago; Army and Navy Club
   of Chicago; University of Wisconsin Club of Chicago; and the Big Foot
   Country Club of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. He was also a Colonel in the
   Reserve Corps of the United States Army.^[61][1] He was also president
   of the North Central Academic Association of Colonial Illinois National
   Guard. He was also associated with the Union League Club, the National
   Geographic Society, and the Navy League.^[62][2]

[[63]edit] Later life and death

   Davidson died on January 16, 1943. He is buried at the [64]Northwestern
   Military and Naval Academy.^[65][4]
