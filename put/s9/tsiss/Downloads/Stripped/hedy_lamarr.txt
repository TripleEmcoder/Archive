   Hedy Lamarr (pronounced [14]/ˈhɛdi/; November 9, 1913 – January 19,
   2000) was an [15]Austrian-American actress. Though known primarily for
   her extraordinary beauty and her celebrity in a film career as a major
   [16]contract star of [17]MGM's [18]"Golden Age", Lamarr was a
   scientist, inventor and mathematician who co-invented an early
   technique for [19]spread spectrum communications, a key to many forms
   of wireless communication from the pre-computer age to the present
   day.^[20][1]

[[35]edit] Early life

   Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in [36]Vienna,
   [37]Austria-Hungary, to [38]Jewish parents Gertrud (née Lichtwitz), a
   pianist and [39]Budapest native who came from the "Jewish haute
   [40]bourgeoisie", and [41]Lemberg-born Emil Kiesler, a successful bank
   director.^[42][2]^[43][3] She studied ballet and piano at age 10. When
   she worked with [44]Max Reinhardt in [45]Berlin, he called her the
   "most beautiful woman in Europe". Soon the teenage girl played major
   roles in [46]German movies, alongside stars like [47]Heinz Rühmann and
   [48]Hans Moser.

[[49]edit] Career

   In early 1933 she starred in [50]Gustav Machatý's notorious film
   [51]Ecstasy, a [52]Czechoslovak film made in [53]Prague, in which she
   played the love-hungry young wife of an indifferent old husband.
   Closeups of her face and long shots of her running nude through the
   woods gave the film notoriety.

   On 10 August 1933 she married [54]Friedrich Mandl, a [55]Vienna-based
   arms manufacturer 13 years her senior. In her autobiography Ecstasy and
   Me, Lamarr described Mandl as an extremely controlling man who
   sometimes tried to keep her shut up in their mansion. The Austrian
   bought as many copies of [56]Ecstasy as he could possibly find,
   objecting to her in the film, and "the expression on her face" (Lamarr
   later claimed the looks of passion were the result of the director
   poking her in the bottom with a safety pin).^[57][4]

   Mandl prevented her from pursuing her acting career, and instead took
   her to meetings with technicians and business partners. In these
   meetings, the mathematically talented Lamarr learned about military
   technology. Otherwise she had to stay at the castle [58]Schloss
   Schwarzenau. She later related that, even though Mandl was
   part-[59]Jewish, he was consorting with [60]Nazi industrialists, which
   infuriated her. In Ecstasy and Me, Lamarr wrote that dictators
   [61]Benito Mussolini and [62]Adolf Hitler both attended Mandl's grand
   parties. She related that in 1937 she disguised herself as one of her
   maids and fled to Paris, where she obtained a divorce, and then moved
   on to London. According to another version of the episode, she
   persuaded Mandl to allow her to attend a party wearing all her
   expensive jewelry, later drugged him with the help of her maid, and
   made her escape out of the country with the jewelry.

[[63]edit] Hollywood

   First she went to Paris, then met [64]Louis B. Mayer in [65]London.
   After he hired her, at his insistence, she changed her name to Hedy
   Lamarr, choosing the surname in homage to a beautiful film star of the
   silent era, [66]Barbara La Marr,^[67][4] who had died in 1926 from a
   drug overdose.
   Lamarr and [68]Robert Walker in [69]Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945)

   In Hollywood, she was usually cast as glamorous and seductive. Her
   American debut was in [70]Algiers (1938). Her many films include
   [71]Boom Town (1940), [72]White Cargo (1942), and [73]Tortilla Flat
   (1942), based on the novel by [74]John Steinbeck. White Cargo, one of
   Lamarr's biggest hits at MGM, contains arguably her most famous film
   quote, "Tondelayo make tiffin". In 1941, she was cast alongside two
   other Hollywood beauties, [75]Lana Turner and [76]Judy Garland in the
   musical extravaganza [77]Ziegfeld Girl.

   She made 18 films from 1940 to 1949 even though she had two children
   during that time (in 1945 and 1947). She left MGM in 1945; Lamarr
   enjoyed her biggest success as [78]Delilah in [79]Cecil B. DeMille's
   [80]Samson and Delilah, the highest-grossing film of 1949, with
   [81]Victor Mature as the [82]Biblical strongman. However, following her
   comedic turn opposite [83]Bob Hope in [84]My Favorite Spy (1951), her
   career went into decline. She appeared only sporadically in films after
   1950, one of her last roles being that of [85]Joan of Arc in [86]Irwin
   Allen's critically panned epic [87]The Story of Mankind (1957).

   The publication of her autobiography [88]Ecstasy and Me (1967) took
   place about a year after accusations of [89]shoplifting, and a year
   after [90]Andy Warhol's short film Hedy (1966), also known as The
   Shoplifter. The controversy surrounding the shoplifting charges
   coincided with a failed return to the screen in Picture Mommy Dead
   (1966). The role was ultimately filled by [91]Zsa Zsa Gabor.
   [92]Ecstasy and Me begins in a despondent mood, with reference to this:

     On a recent evening, sitting home alone suffering and brooding about
     my treatment at the police station because of an incident in a
     department store, and being replaced by Zsa Zsa Gabor in a motion
     picture (imagine how that pleased the ego!) I figured out that I had
     made – and spent – some thirty million dollars. Yet earlier that day
     I had been unable to pay for a sandwich at [93]Schwab's drug-store.

[[94]edit] Frequency-hopping spread-spectrum invention

   [95]Avant garde composer [96]George Antheil, a son of German immigrants
   and neighbor of Lamarr, had experimented with automated control of
   musical instruments, including his music for [97]Ballet Mecanique,
   originally written for [98]Fernand Léger's 1924 abstract film. This
   score involved multiple [99]player pianos playing simultaneously.

   Together, Antheil and Lamarr submitted the idea of a secret
   communication system in June 1941. On August 11, 1942, [100]US Patent
   2,292,387 was granted to Antheil and "Hedy Kiesler Markey", Lamarr's
   married name at the time. This early version of [101]frequency hopping
   used a [102]piano roll to change between 88 frequencies and was
   intended to make radio-guided [103]torpedoes harder for enemies to
   detect or jam.

   The idea was not implemented in the USA until 1962, when it was used by
   U.S. military ships during a blockade of Cuba^[104][5] after the patent
   had expired. Perhaps owing to this lag in development, the patent was
   little-known until 1997, when the [105]Electronic Frontier Foundation
   gave Lamarr an award for this contribution.^[106][1] In 1998, Ottawa
   wireless technology developer Wi-LAN, Inc. "acquired a 49 percent claim
   to the patent from Lamarr for an undisclosed amount of stock" (Eliza
   Schmidkunz, Inside GNSS);^[107][6] Antheil had died in 1959.

   Lamarr's and Antheil's frequency-hopping idea serves as a basis for
   modern [108]spread-spectrum communication technology, such as
   [109]COFDM used in [110]Wi-Fi network connections and [111]CDMA used in
   some cordless and wireless telephones.^[112][7] Blackwell, Martin, and
   Vernam's 1920 patent Secrecy Communication System ([113]1598673) seems
   to lay the communications groundwork for Kiesler and Antheil's patent
   which employed the techniques in the autonomous control of torpedoes.

   Lamarr wanted to join the [114]National Inventors Council, but she was
   told that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity
   status to sell [115]War Bonds. She once raised $7,000,000 at just one
   event.

   For several years during the 1990s, the boxes of the current
   [116]CorelDRAW software suites were graced by a large Corel-drawn image
   of Hedy Lamarr, in tribute to her pre-computer scientific discoveries.
   These pictures were winners in CorelDRAW's yearly software suite cover
   design contests. Far from being flattered, however, Lamarr sued Corel
   for using the image without her permission. Corel countered that she
   did not own rights to the image. They reached an undisclosed settlement
   in 1999.^[117][8]

[[118]edit] Later years

   In the ensuing years, Lamarr retreated from public life, and settled in
   [119]Florida. She returned to the headlines in 1991 when the
   78-year-old former actress was again accused of shoplifting $21.00
   worth of goods, although charges were eventually dropped.

   For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Hedy Lamarr has a
   star on the [120]Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6247 Hollywood
   Blvd.^[121][9]

[[122]edit] Personal life

   Lamarr became a [123]naturalized citizen of the [124]United States on
   April 10, 1953.

[[125]edit] Marriages and romances

   She was briefly engaged to German actor Fred Doederlein, and later
   actor [126]George Montgomery in 1942.^[127][10] Lamarr was also married
   to:
     * [128]Friedrich Mandl (1900–1977), married 1933–1937; chairman of
       Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik, a leading armaments firm founded by
       his father, Alexander Mandl. Mandl, partially of Jewish descent,
       was a supporter of [129]Austrofascism, although not Nazism.
     * [130]Gene Markey (1895–1980), screenwriter and producer, married
       1939–1941; son (adopted in 1941, after their divorce), James Lamarr
       Markey (b. 1939).^[131][11] When Lamarr and Markey divorced — she
       claimed they had only spent four evenings alone together in their
       marriage — the judge advised her to get to know any future husband
       longer than the four weeks she had known Markey.
     * [132]John Loder (born John Muir Lowe, 1898–1988), actor, married
       1943–1947; two children: Anthony Loder (b. 1947) and Denise Loder
       (b. 1945). Loder adopted Hedy's son, James Lamarr Markey, and gave
       him his surname. James Lamarr Loder later challenged Hedy Lamarr's
       will in 2000, which did not mention him. He later dropped his suit
       against the estate in exchange for a lump-sum payment of $50,000.
       Anthony Loder is featured in the European [133]documentary film
       Calling Hedy Lamarr (2004).^[134][12]
     * [135]Ernest "Ted" Stauffer (1909–1991), nightclub owner,
       restaurateur, and former bandleader, married 1951–1952.
     * W. Howard Lee (1909–1981), a Texas oilman, married 1953–1960. In
       1960, he later married film star [136]Gene Tierney.
     * Lewis J. Boies (b. 1920), a lawyer (her divorce lawyer), married
       1963–1965.

   The final affair mentioned in [137]Ecstasy and Me is when Lamarr is
   around 50 and is with a much younger man, an artist called Pierre who
   Lamarr describes as "a very handsome young man ... he was a sensitive
   man; I liked him immediately." During this affair, Lamarr collaborated
   with Pierre on his paintings and lived a somewhat bohemian lifestyle.
   "In the new house we didn't have electricity or gas and it was freezing
   cold. We found a few candles and we sat near them trying to keep
   warm... we just painted, made love and ate once in a while."

[[138]edit] Scandals

   In 1965 Lamarr was arrested for shoplifting in Los Angeles; the charges
   were eventually dropped. In 1991 she was arrested on the same charge in
   Florida, this time for $21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She
   pleaded "no contest" to avoid a court appearance, and in return for a
   promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year, the charges were
   once again dropped.^[139][13]

   According to her [140]autobiography, Ecstasy and Me (1966), once while
   running away from Friedrich Mandl, she slipped into a [141]brothel and
   hid in an empty room. While her husband searched the brothel, a man
   entered the room and she had sex with him so she could remain hidden.
   She was finally successful in escaping when she hired a new [142]maid
   who resembled her; she drugged the maid and used her uniform as a
   disguise to escape.^[143][14] Lamarr later sued the publisher claiming
   that many of the [144]anecdotes in the book, which was described by a
   judge as "filthy, nauseating, and revolting", were fabricated by its
   [145]ghost writer, Leo Guild.^[146][15]^[147][16]

   In an interview included in the [148]DVD release of [149]Blazing
   Saddles (1974), [150]Mel Brooks claims that Hedy Lamarr threatened to
   sue the producers. He says she believed the film's running "Hedley
   Lamarr" joke infringed her [151]right of publicity. In one scene,
   Brooks' character tells Hedley Lamarr, "This is 1874 - you'll be able
   to sue her!" Brooks says they [152]settled out of court for a small
   sum.

[[153]edit] Death and legacy

   John Hodiak and Lamarr in [154]A Lady Without Passport (1950)

   Lamarr died in [155]Casselberry, Florida (near [156]Orlando) on January
   19, 2000. Her son Anthony Loder took her ashes to Austria and spread
   them in the [157]Wienerwald forest, in accordance with her
   wishes.^[158][12]

   In the 1974 [159]Mel Brooks film [160]Blazing Saddles, [161]Harvey
   Korman's character is named Hedley Lamarr. In one scene, Brooks's
   character calls him "Hedy", and Korman corrects him saying "It's
   Hedley" to which Brooks replies "What are you worried about? This is
   1874... you'll be able to sue her!"

   A date with Hedy Lamarr is one of the promises Audrey II tempts Seymour
   with in the musical Little Shop of Horrors

   In 2003, the [162]Boeing corporation ran a series of recruitment ads
   featuring Hedy Lamarr as a woman of science. No reference to her film
   career was made in the ads.^[163][17]

   In 2004, the game [164]Half-Life 2, which contains many references to
   important names, situations and facts in science, made an [165]homage
   to Hedy, by giving the name Lamarr to [166]Dr. Kleiner's beloved pet
   [167]headcrab. Later on in the game, Dr. Kleiner specifically refers to
   the pet as Hedy.

   In 2005, the first [168]Inventor's Day in [169]German-speaking
   countries was held in her honor on November 9, on what would have been
   her 92nd birthday.^[[170]citation needed]

   The 2010 New York Public Library's exhibit: “Thirty Years of
   Photography at the New York Public Library” includes a photo of topless
   Lamarr (ca. 1930) by Austrian-born American photographer Trude
   Fleischmann.^[171][18]
