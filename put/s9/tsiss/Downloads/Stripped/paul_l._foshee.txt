   Occupation [20]Businessman

   Paul Lee Foshee, Sr. (born November 12, 1932), is a retired [21]crop
   duster from [22]Natchitoches, [23]Louisiana, who served
   nonconsecutively in both houses of the [24]Louisiana State Legislature
   during the [25]1960s and [26]1970s. From 1960-1964, beginning at the
   age of twenty-seven, Foshee served a single four-year term as a
   [27]state representative from [28]Natchitoches Parish. He and former
   Representative [29]Curtis Boozman (1898–1979)^[30][1] were elected in a
   two-member district in which the [31]incumbents, Monnie T. Cheves and
   E.H. Haynes, were unseated in the 1959-1960 election cycle. Haynes was
   a former [32]agriculture [33]teacher at [34]Natchitoches High
   School.^[35][2]

   Eight years later, Foshee was elected to a single term in the
   [36]Louisiana State Senate. He unseated 20-year [37]Democratic Senator
   [38]Sylvan N. Friedman, a pro-[39]Long [40]farmer, [41]cattleman, and
   large landowner from [42]Natchez in Natchitoches Parish (not to be
   confused with [43]Natchez, Mississippi). After securing the pivotal
   Democratic nomination, Foshee then handily defeated in the [44]general
   election held on February 1, 1972, the [45]Republican [46]Bob
   Reese,^[47][1] a businessman who later became chairman of the
   Natchitoches Parish Board of Election Supervisors and served on the
   Republican State Central Committee from 1968-1996.^[48][3] Reese had
   earlier run for the Louisiana House from [49]Jackson Parish, having
   been defeated by future [50]Speaker [51]E.L. "Bubba" Henry.^[52][4]

   In the first ever [53]nonpartisan blanket primary in 1975, Foshee was
   unseated by his fellow Democrat, [54]Donald G. Kelly, a Natchitoches
   [55]attorney originally from [56]Coushatta, the seat of [57]Red River
   Parish.^[58][5] In 1979, Foshee’s 23-year-old son, George Barnes
   "Barney" Foshee (1956–2000),^[59][1] failed in an attempt to unseat
   Kelly, who scored the second of his five terms in the state Senate. In
   1987, Foshee himself unsuccessfully challenged Kelly, 25,619 votes
   (62.5 percent) to 15,346 (37.5 percent)^[60][6]

   Foshee is descended from an old-line Natchitoches family, which first
   came to the [61]Cane River area from [62]Paris, [63]France, in
   1690.^[64][7] His parents, who married in 1928, were George Washington
   Foshee (1893–1973),^[65][1] a veteran of [66]World War I and a
   [67]sawmill operator in Natchitoches, and the former Mamie Lee Smith
   (1906–1991).^[68][1] Foshee was reared in the [69]Baptist Church. In
   1950, he graduated from Natchitoches High School (renamed
   [70]Natchitoches Central High School after [71]desegregation), and in
   1961, he completed studies for a [72]bachelor's degree in social
   science at [73]Northwestern State University in Natchitoches.^[74][7]

   Foshee himself has been married and [75]divorced six times. From his
   first marriage to the former Charlene Addington, the daughter of
   Charles Garland Addington and the former Wanda Vera Smiddy (1916–1975),
   he had four children.^[76][8] Paul Foshee, Jr. (born 1951), operates
   Foshee Dusting Company in Natchitoches, the business that Foshee
   founded in 1952. Foshee, Sr., retired from flying in 1998.^[77][9]

   From the first marriage, Foshee also has a daughter, Fran Lea Foshee
   Poole, and the late son, George Foshee.^[78][8] A fourth child from the
   first marriage, Christie Cheryl Foshee, died at birth; no dates are
   marked on her gravestone in Fern Cemetery in Natchitoches.^[79][10]
   From the second marriage to the former Venita Ann Higgs, since
   deceased, Foshee had a third son, Lane Chase Foshee (1970–1999). He has
   no children from his subsequent marriages to the former Martha
   Martinez, Joyce Wall, Karen Cook,^[80][7] and Katherine Joan Phares
   (born ca. 1938), who resides in [81]Shreveport.^[82][8]

   Foshee considers himself to have been an independent "good government"
   type of legislator, concerned in particular about bills relating to
   insurance, reducing taxes, and removing from the state payroll,
   so-called "deadheads" or phantom employees who perform little or no
   actual work for their government checks. Though outgoing [83]Governor
   [84]Earl Kemp Long supported Foshee's initial election to the House,
   Foshee considered himself neither "pro-Long" nor "anti-Long" within his
   state's then dominant Democratic Party.^[85][7]

   Foshee holds [86]Patent 5033695, July 23, 1991, on the Aileron
   counterbalance mount bracket used on the Brumann crop dusting plane.
   The device operates similarly to [87]power steering in automobiles. The
   patent expired in 2010.^[88][11]
