                Oliver Evans
   Born 13 September 1755(1755-09-13)
        [7]Newport, Delaware
   Died 15 April 1819(1819-04-15) (aged 63)
        [8]New York, New York

   Oliver Evans (13 September 1755 – 15 April 1819) was an [9]American
   [10]inventor. Evans was born in [11]Newport, Delaware to a family of
   [12]Welsh settlers. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a
   [13]wheelwright.

   Evans' first invention was in 1777, when he designed a machine for
   making card teeth for [14]carding [15]wool. He went into business with
   his brothers and produced a number of improvements in the flour milling
   industry.^[16][1] His most important invention was an automated
   [17]grist mill which operated continuously through the use of [18]bulk
   material handling devices including [19]bucket elevators, [20]conveyor
   belts, and [21]Archimedean screws. Evans described this invention in
   The Young Mill-wright and Millers' Guide. He [22]patented this
   invention in a few states and, when the US patent system was
   established, in the federal patent system. Evans devoted a great deal
   of his time to patents, patent extensions, and enforcement of his
   patents.^[23][2]

   In 1792 he moved to [24]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

   He produced an improved high-pressure [25]steam engine — his second
   most important invention. For some years he contemplated the idea of
   applying steam power to wagons. He was granted a [26]patent for a
   steam-carriage design in 1789, but did not produce a working example of
   such a machine until over a decade later. (See below on his Oruktor
   Amphibolos). Part of his difficulties was a failure to get financial
   backing. After lack of support in his native land, in 1794 he sent
   copies of some his designs to [27]Great Britain in an attempt to
   interest investors there.

   As Evans designed a refrigeration machine which ran on vapor in 1805,
   he is often called the inventor of the refrigerator, although he never
   built one. (His design was modified by [28]Jacob Perkins, who obtained
   the first patent for a refrigerating machine in 1834).

[[38]edit] The Oruktor Amphibolos

   The Oruktor Amphibolos, as illustrated in "The Boston mechanic and
   journal of the useful arts and sciences" (July, 1834)

   The device for which Oliver Evans is best-known today is his Oruktor
   Amphibolos, or "Amphibious Digger", built on commission from the
   Philadelphia Board of Health. The Board was concerned with the problem
   of dredging and cleaning the city's dockyards, and in 1805 Evans
   convinced them to contract with him for a steam-powered dredge.

   No technical drawings of the device survive, and the only evidence for
   its design come from Oliver Evans' own descriptions, which are
   contradictory, and most likely exaggerated. He describes the vehicle as
   a 30-foot (9.1 m) long 15 ton scow, powered by a 5 [39]horse-power
   steam engine. For a demonstration of his long-held beliefs in the
   possibility of land steam demonstration, Evans mounted the hull on 4
   [40]wheels and may have connected the engine to them, to drive it
   through Philadelphia streets on the way to the river. The small size of
   the engine, the large size of the vehicle, and the lack of any
   contemporary evidence other than Evans' own writings for it make this
   seem unlikely. Evans claimed that his dredge was the first self-powered
   [41]amphibious vehicle, as well as the first self-powered land vehicle
   in the United States (steam powered road vehicles had already been used
   earlier in [42]France and [43]Great Britain). The Oruktor Amphibolos
   was never a success as a dredge, and after a few years of sitting at
   the dock was sold for parts.

   Subsequently, Evans wrote about the Oruktor in many publications, and
   each time the achievements became more impressive. He also 'corrected'
   the date of the machine from 1805 to 1804, possibly in a dispute about
   steamboat patents, and this inaccuracy has since been perpetuated by
   several commentators.^[44][3]
   Evans design for automated flour milling

   Oliver Evans wrote up proposals to mechanize road vehicles, but failed
   to get backing from investors, who saw the scheme as impractical. In
   1812 he published a visionary description of the nation connected by a
   network of [45]railroad lines with transportation by swift steam
   [46]locomotives. It should be remembered that at the time the
   locomotive was little more than a crude curiosity, and no attempts to
   use it for long distance transport had yet been made; see: [47]History
   of rail transport.

[[48]edit] Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company

   In 1811, he founded the [49]Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in
   addition to engines made other heavy machinery and castings in
   [50]Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The location of the factory in the
   Mississippi watershed was important in the development of high pressure
   steam engines for the use in riverboats.

[[51]edit] Death

   In 1819, while in [52]New York City, Oliver Evans was informed that his
   workshop in Philadelphia had burned to the ground. Evans suffered from
   a [53]stroke at the news, and died soon after. He is buried in Trinity
   Cemetery, [54]Broadway at 154th Street, New York City.^[55][4]

[[56]edit] Tributes

   In [57]World War II the [58]United States [59]liberty ship [60]SS
   Oliver Evans was named in his honor.
