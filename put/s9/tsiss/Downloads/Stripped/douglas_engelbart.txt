   Douglas Carl Engelbart (born January 30, 1925) is an [31]American
   [32]inventor and early computer pioneer. He is best known for inventing
   the [33]computer mouse,^[34][1] as a pioneer of [35]human-computer
   interaction whose team developed [36]hypertext, networked computers,
   and precursors to [37]GUIs; and as a committed and vocal proponent of
   the development and use of [38]computers and [39]networks to help cope
   with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems.^[40][2]

   Engelbart had embedded in his lab a set of organizing principles, which
   he termed his "bootstrapping strategy", which he specifically designed
   to bootstrap and accelerate the rate of innovation achievable.^[41][3]

Early life and education

   Engelbart was born in the [55]U.S. state of [56]Oregon on January 30,
   1925 to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson
   Engelbart. He is of [57]German, [58]Swedish and [59]Norwegian
   descent.^[60][4]

   He was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (3 years
   older), and a brother David (14 months younger). They lived in Portland
   in his early years, and moved to the countryside to a place called
   Johnson Creek when he was 9 or 10, after the death of his father. He
   graduated from [61]Portland's [62]Franklin High School in 1942.

   Midway through his college studies at [63]Oregon State University (then
   called Oregon State College), just at the end of World War II, he was
   drafted into the Navy, serving two years as a [64]radar [65]technician
   in the [66]Philippines. It was there on a small island in a tiny hut up
   on stilts that he first read [67]Vannevar Bush's article "[68]As We May
   Think", which greatly inspired him. He returned to Oregon State and
   completed his [69]Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1948,
   a B.Eng. from [70]UC Berkeley in 1952,^[71][5] and a [72]Ph.D. in
   [73]EECS from UC Berkeley in 1955. While at Oregon State, he was a
   member of [74]Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.

   As a graduate student at Berkeley he assisted in the construction of
   the California Digital Computer project [75]CALDIC. His graduate work
   led to several patents.^[76][6] After completing his PhD he stayed on
   at Berkeley to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could
   not pursue his vision there. He then formed a [77]startup, Digital
   Techniques, to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage
   devices, but after a year decided instead to find a venue where he
   could pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951 (see
   Epiphany).

Career and accomplishments

   The first [78]computer mouse held by Engelbart showing the wheels that
   directly contact the working surface.

Epiphany

   Doug Engelbart's career was inspired in 1951 when he got engaged and
   suddenly realized he had no career goals beyond getting a good
   education and a decent job. Over several months he reasoned that: (1)
   he would focus his career on making the world a better place; (2) any
   serious effort to make the world better requires some kind of organized
   effort; (3) harnessing the collective human intellect of all the people
   contributing to effective solutions was the key; (4) if you could
   dramatically improve how we do that, you'd be boosting every effort on
   the planet to solve important problems - the sooner the better; and (5)
   computers could be the vehicle for dramatically improving this
   capability.

   In 1945, Engelbart had read with interest [79]Vannevar Bush's article
   "[80]As We May Think",^[81][7] a call to arms for making knowledge
   widely available as a national peacetime grand challenge. Doug had also
   read something about computers (a relatively recent phenomenon), and
   from his experience as a radar technician he knew that information
   could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He suddenly envisioned
   intellectual workers sitting at display 'working stations', flying
   through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual
   capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful
   ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive
   computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were
   viewed as number crunching tools. He went to UC Berkeley to learn
   everything he could about computers, got his PhD, and was told to be
   very careful about who he talked to about his "wild" ideas. After a
   year of teaching at Berkeley as Acting Assistant Professor, he took a
   position at [82]Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in [83]Menlo Park,
   hoping one day to pursue his vision there. He initially worked for
   [84]Hewitt Crane on devices. He and Hew became lifelong friends.

SRI and ARC

   At SRI, Engelbart gradually proved himself with over a dozen patents to
   his name (some resulting from his graduate work), and within a few
   years was funded to produce a report about his vision and proposed
   research agenda titled Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual
   Framework.^[85][8] This led to funding from [86]ARPA to launch his
   work. Engelbart recruited a research team in his new [87]Augmentation
   Research Center (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI), and became the
   driving force behind the design and development of the On-Line System,
   or [88]NLS. He and his team developed computer-interface elements such
   as bit-mapped screens, the mouse, [89]hypertext, collaborative tools,
   and precursors to the [90]graphical user interface. He conceived and
   developed many of his user interface ideas back in the mid-1960s, long
   before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most
   individuals were kept away from computers, and could only use computers
   through intermediaries (see [91]batch processing), and when software
   tended to be written for [92]vertical applications in proprietary
   systems.
   Two [93]Apple Macintosh Plus mice, 1986

   Engelbart applied for a [94]patent in 1967 and received it in 1970, for
   the wooden shell with two metal wheels ([95]computer mouse - [96]U.S.
   Patent 3,541,541), which he had developed with Bill English, his lead
   engineer, a few years earlier. In the patent application it is
   described as an "X-Y position indicator for a display system".
   Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the "mouse" because the
   tail came out the end. His group also called the on-screen cursor a
   "bug", but this term was not widely adopted.

   He never received any [97]royalties for his mouse invention. During an
   interview, he says "[98]SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no
   idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had
   licensed it to [99]Apple for something like $40,000."

   Engelbart showcased the [100]chorded keyboard and many more of his and
   ARC's inventions in 1968 at the so-called [101]mother of all
   demos.^[102][9]

ARPANET

   Engelbart's research was funded by [103]ARPA, SRI's ARC became involved
   with the [104]ARPANET (the precursor of the [105]Internet).

   On October 29, 1969, the world's first electronic computer network, the
   [106]ARPANET, was established between nodes at [107]Leonard Kleinrock's
   lab at [108]UCLA and Engelbart's lab at SRI. [109]Interface Message
   Processors at both sites served as the [110]backbone of the first
   [111]Internet.^[112][10]

   In addition to SRI and UCLA, [113]UCSB, and the [114]University of Utah
   were part of the original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the
   entire 4-node network was connected.

   ARC soon became the first [115]Network Information Center and thus
   managed the directory for connections among all ARPANET nodes. ARC also
   published a large percentage of the early [116]Request For Comments, an
   ongoing series of publications that document the evolution of
   ARPANET/Internet.

Anecdotal notes

   [117]Historian of science [118]Thierry Bardini has argued that
   Engelbart's complex personal philosophy (which drove all his research
   endeavors) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of
   [119]coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology.

   Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the
   [120]principle of linguistic relativity developed by [121]Benjamin Lee
   Whorf.^[122][11] Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a
   language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be
   expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the
   state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate
   information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop
   new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary
   task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating
   information directly, and also to improve individual and group
   processes for knowledge-work.

   Engelbart's philosophy and research agenda is most clearly and directly
   expressed in the 1962 research report which Engelbart refers to as his
   'bible': [123]Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework. The
   concept of network-augmented intelligence is attributed to Engelbart
   based on this pioneering work.

End of research career and subsequent developments

   Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity after 1976. Several of
   Engelbart's researchers became alienated from him and left his
   organization for [124]Xerox PARC, in part due to frustration, and in
   part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw
   the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server)
   computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal
   computer. The conflict was both technical and social: the younger
   programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly
   suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.

   Engelbart served on the board of directors of [125]Erhard Seminars
   Training. Several key ARC personnel were also involved. Although EST
   seemed like a good idea at first, the controversial nature of EST
   reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community according
   to Bardini's book.

   The [126]Mansfield Amendment, the end of the [127]Vietnam War, and the
   end of the [128]Apollo program reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and
   [129]NASA. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach
   to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of
   [130]artificial intelligence researcher [131]Bertram Raphael, who
   negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called
   [132]Tymshare. Engelbart's house in [133]Atherton burned down during
   this period, causing him and his family even further problems. Tymshare
   took over [134]NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most
   of the lab's staff including its creator as a Senior Scientist, renamed
   the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its
   new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar
   with NLS; back when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with
   its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called
   OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.

   At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to
   obscurity. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire
   to do further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later
   at [135]McDonnell Douglas (which took over Tymshare in 1984), expressed
   interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to
   further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was
   focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements
   involved in the lifecycle of an aerospace program, which served to
   strengthen Doug's resolve to motivate the IT arena toward global
   interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.^[136][12] Engelbart
   retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to raise a flag on
   neutral ground where he could pursue his work in earnest.

   Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, in 1988 he founded the
   Bootstrap Institute with modest funding to coalesce his ideas into a
   series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at
   Stanford University 1989–2000, which served to refine his ideas while
   inspiring candidate participants. By the early 1990s there was
   sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a
   collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance
   was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the
   invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of
   belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the
   efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management
   seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s
   they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface
   to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT), while participating in a
   larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.

Honors

   Since the late 1980s, prominent individuals and organizations have
   recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's
   contributions:^[137][13]

   In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, he was the
   first recipient of what would later become the [138]Yuri Rubinsky
   Memorial Award. In 1997 he was awarded the [139]Lemelson-MIT Prize of
   $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and
   innovation, and the ACM [140]Turing Award. To mark the 30th anniversary
   of Engelbart's 1968 demo, in 1998 the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives
   [141][3] and the [142]Institute for the Future hosted Engelbart's
   Unfinished Revolution[143][4], a large [144]symposium at [145]Stanford
   University's Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas.
   Also that year, [146]ACM [147]SIGCHI awarded him the CHI Lifetime
   Achievement Award (and inducted him into the [148]CHI Academy in 2002).

   Engelbart was awarded [149]The Franklin Institute's Certificate of
   Merit in 1996 and [150]The Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1999 in Computer
   and Cognitive Science.

   In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with a dedicated team of volunteers
   and sponsors, what was called The Unfinished Revolution — II[151][5],
   also known as the Engelbart Colloquium at Stanford University, to
   document and publicize his work and ideas to a larger audience (live,
   and online).^[152][14]^[153][15]

   In December 2000, US President [154]Bill Clinton awarded Engelbart the
   [155]National Medal of Technology, the United States' highest
   technology award. In 2001 he was awarded a [156]British Computer
   Society's [157]Lovelace Medal, and in 2005 he was made a Fellow of the
   [158]Computer History Museum and honored with the [159]Norbert Wiener
   Award, which is given annually by [160]Computer Professionals for
   Social Responsibility.

   [161]Robert X. Cringely did an hour long interview with Dr. Engelbart
   on 9 December 2005 in his NerdTV [162][6] video podcast series. On
   December 9, 2008, Engelbart was honored at the 40th Anniversary
   celebration of the 1968 "[163]Mother of All Demos".^[164][16] This
   event, produced by SRI International, was held at Memorial Auditorium
   at Stanford University. Speakers included several members of
   Engelbart's original Augmentation Research Center (ARC) team including
   Don Andrews, Bill Paxton, Bill English, and [165]Jeff Rulifson,
   Engelbart's chief government sponsor [166]Bob Taylor, and other
   pioneers of interactive computing, including [167]Andy van Dam and
   [168]Alan Kay. In addition, Christina Engelbart spoke about her
   father's early influences and the ongoing work of the Doug Engelbart
   Institute.^[169][17] In June 2009, the [170]New Media Consortium
   recognized Engelbart as an NMC Fellow ^[171][18] for his lifetime of
   achievements.

At present

   Doug Engelbart attended Program for the Future 2010
   Conference^[172][19] where hundreds of people convened at The Tech
   Museum in San Jose and online to engage in dialog about how to pursue
   Doug Engelbart's vision to augment collective intelligence.

   The most complete coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping ideas can be
   found in Boosting Our Collective IQ,^[173][20] by Douglas C. Engelbart,
   1995. This is a special keepsake including three of Engelbart's key
   papers, artfully edited and produced into book form by Yuri Rubinsky
   and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995
   SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference
   in Boston that December, honoring his early and seminal contribution to
   the hypertext systems. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and
   100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Doug Engelbart and [174]Tim
   Berners-Lee. 30 pages, 5.5″×9″ includes Epilogue and details of the
   Award. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart
   Institute.^[175][21]

   Two comprehensive histories of Engelbart's laboratory and work are in
   What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the
   Personal Computer Industry by [176]John Markoff and A Heritage of
   Innovation: SRI's First Half Century[177][7] by Donald Neilson. Other
   books on Engelbart and his laboratory include Bootstrapping: Douglas
   Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing by
   [178]Thierry Bardini and The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas
   Engelbart, by [179]Valerie Landau and [180]Eileen Clegg in conversation
   with Douglas Engelbart.^[181][22] All four of these books are based on
   interviews with Engelbart as well as other contributors in his
   laboratory.

   Engelbart is now Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute,
   which he founded in 1988 with his daughter Christina Engelbart, who is
   now Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy
   for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we
   can solve important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping
   approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal.^[182][23]

   In 2005 Engelbart received a [183]National Science Foundation grant to
   fund the open source HyperScope [184][8] project. The Hyperscope team
   built a browser component using [185]Ajax and [186]DHTML designed to
   replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking
   within and across various documents). HyperScope is perceived as the
   first step of a process designed to engage a wider community in a
   dialogue, on development of collaborative software and services, based
   on Engelbart's goals and research. The Doug Engelbart Institute is now
   based at [187]SRI International.

   Engelbart has served on the Advisory Boards of the University of Santa
   Clara Center for Science, Technology, and Society [188][9], Foresight
   Institute [189][10], Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
   The Technology Center of Silicon Valley, and The Hyperwords Company Ltd
   (producer of the free Firefox Add-On called
   '[190]Hyperwords'.^[191][24]

Family

   Dr. Engelbart has four children, Gerda, Diana, Christina and Norman
   with his late wife of 47 years, Ballard who died in 1997. He has nine
   grandchildren. He remarried on January 26, 2008 to Karen O'Leary
   Engelbart.^[192][25]
