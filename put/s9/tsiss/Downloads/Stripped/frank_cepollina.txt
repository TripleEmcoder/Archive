[[34]edit] Life and education

   A [35]Northern California native, Cepollina was born in 1936 in
   [36]Castro Valley. He attended the [37]University of Santa Clara and
   earned a [38]B.S. in [39]mechanical engineering in 1959. Before joining
   [40]NASA in 1963, he worked for four years for the [41]Aerojet General
   Corporation and the [42]Defense Intelligence Agency. When he was 27
   years old, he signed on with NASA's [43]Goddard Space Flight Center
   where he helped developing several [44]spacecraft. He also led the
   development of the [45]Explorer Platform, which enabled the exchange of
   scientific [46]payloads in [47]orbit.

   Since his early career, he specialized in designing [48]satellites and
   spacecraft, and looked for engineering solutions that would make
   satellites more robust. The problems he dealt with were the
   difficulties spacecraft industry was facing in the late 1960s. His list
   of accomplishments includes innovative techniques for servicing
   satellites, designing new tools and interfaces for [49]astronauts, and
   leading the historic 1993 repair mission for the [50]Hubble Space
   Telescope.

   Cepollina is a researcher even in his everyday life; it is noted that
   when he is not busy looking for ways to improve Hubble's eye on the
   universe, he can be found at home tinkering with model [51]O gauge
   [52]railroads. "I've found great satisfaction in this hobby for more
   than 40 years," he says. "And it's a nice escape from the daily
   grind.^[53][1] "

   Cepollina is currently the manager of NASA's [54]Hubble Space Telescope
   Development Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in
   [55]Greenbelt, [56]Maryland. He and his wife, Ann [deceased] raised
   their 4 children in [57]Annandale, [58]Virginia. Cepollina has eight
   grandchildren (one deceased) located in the Northern Virginia area, as
   well as on the West Coast.

[[59]edit] Cepollina as an inventor

   It is important to note the dissatisfaction and the problems in the
   early days of [60]space exploration in order to understand better the
   improvements made by Cepollina. The amount of engineering and effort
   required to do work in space were surprising for the engineers in the
   early days of the manned space program. For instance, the astronauts
   [61]Eugene Cernan and [62]Thomas Stafford who were launched into space
   aboard [63]Gemini 9 on June 3, 1966 had to deal with unimagined
   difficulties as soon as Cernan began a [64]space walk. The plan called
   for Cernan to take some [65]photographs and enjoy [66]weightlessness
   for a few minutes before working his way to the rear of the capsule.
   From the moment he emerged from the capsule, everything Cernan did was
   much harder than what he expected. He said his space suit felt like a
   suit of armor, and that every weightless movement triggered an
   [67]equal, opposite reaction. He found himself repeatedly flying out to
   the end of the [68]umbilical cord connecting him to the [69]Gemini
   capsule and then rebounding in an unexpected direction. [70]Medics on
   the ground were alarmed when his heart rate increased to 155 [71]beats
   a minute. He perspired enough to fog his helmet visor, and sweat pooled
   in his eyes . He ripped an insulating layer in the back of his suit,
   and he instantly felt the fierce, bare sunshine; he returned to
   [72]Earth with painful burns.^[73][2]

   Cepollina marks that “the experiences of NASA’s first space walkers
   pioneered a lot of the technologies we use today.” First of all, these
   initial attempts made clear the need for a change in space-suit design.
   The [74]Gemini 9 astronauts wore suits inflated to 14 [75]pounds per
   square inch because that’s about normal pressure on earth. NASA cut the
   level to 4 PSI, reducing the feeling of working inside an overinflated
   [76]balloon. Furthermore, a new training was developed for moving about
   in space: practice sessions underwater since moving in a liquid
   resembles the effects of weightlessness.^[77][3] However, the main
   challenge was conquering the exhaustion that Cernan had encountered.
   Cepollina states that their solution was to come up with [78]power
   tools they could use to limit [79]fatigue, and in order to reduce
   fatigue, an engineer in Cepollina’s team, [80]Paul Richard came up with
   a pistol-grip device that looks like a battery-powered hand drill on
   steroids.

   In-Orbit Servicing In his article “In-Orbit Servicing”, Cepollina
   states that in the late 1960s, as inflation and constrained budgets
   limited the space program, NASA determined three ways of reducing
   costs: standardized spacecraft components; use of the same spacecraft
   to do several missions; and use of the [81]Shuttle to extend or renew
   the useful life of the spacecraft by replacing [82]subsystems and
   instruments in the orbit.^[83][4]

   Why in-orbit servicing? [84]Earth Observing System (EOS), which is a
   program of NASA comprising a series of artificial satellite missions
   and scientific instruments in Earth orbit, asked [85]Grumman Aerospace,
   [86]General Electric and [87]TRW Systems to define the most cost
   effective mode for using the space shuttle. The companies identified
   four different methods of “renewing” the defective spacecrafts^[88][5]:

   - Launch replacement satellites on conventional booster

   - Launch replacement satellites by shuttle

   - Launch replacement satellites by any of the methods mentioned above
   and retrieve the defective one for ground refurbishment by Shuttle

   - Replace the malfunctioning system of the defective satellite in orbit
   by Shuttle

   When the costs of these four methods were compared, in-orbit servicing
   was found to be the lowest.

   What are the changes that comes with in-orbit servicing? On the other
   hand, such an approach called for a totally different spacecraft
   design. In this new concept, each subsystem occupied its own separate
   drawer or removable module in the spacecraft. For example, all the
   components having to do with supplying power (the power unit of the
   space craft) would make up one module so that if something wrong
   happened with the power unit, that part of the spacecraft was easily
   taken out and renewed.

[[89]edit] In-Orbit Serviced Satellites

   From his early days with NASA, Cepollina has worked on engineering
   solutions for satellites and spacecraft. In the late 1960s, satellite
   failure was becoming a significant problem, and engineers at NASA,
   including Cepollina, began working on a new type of [90]Multimission
   Modular Craft.^[91][6] As described by Cepollina, these crafts would
   have swappable parts and could potentially be fixed easily by
   space-walking astronauts.

[[92]edit] Solar Maximum Mission Satellite

   The first modular craft to fly was the [93]Solar Maximum Mission
   satellite, launched in 1980 to conduct astronomical observations of the
   sun.^[94][7] When it began to fail several months into orbit, Cepollina
   was asked to lead the repair mission, begun in 1984. The mission the
   first of its kind was a success; the modular craft concept proved
   effective. Cepollina was lauded for his leadership on the project and
   was subsequently named Satellite Servicing Project Manager.^[95][8]

[[96]edit] Hubble Space Telescope

   After the [97]Solar Maximum Mission Satellite, as the Satellite
   Servicing Project Manager, Cepollina was faced with an enormous
   challenge: repairing the [98]Hubble Space Telescope. The mission he
   undertook has widely been cited as the most difficult on-orbit repair
   mission ever attempted. Having worked on the development of its modular
   design, as well as its command and control subsystem, Cepollina knew
   the Hubble well. However, few could have anticipated that the Hubble,
   launched in 1990 and orbiting 375 miles above the Earth, would have
   such a simple but crucial problem: a flawed mirror.^[99][9] NASA
   officials were appalled and embarrassed to discover that the contractor
   responsible had a miscalculation that made the telescope incapable of
   coming to a sharp focus.^[100][10]

   This unexpected problem was too serious to fix by simply swapping out a
   defective module, so Cepollina became project manager of a hurriedly
   assembled team charged with repairing the telescope. “The first Hubble
   repair mission took us to the next level of servicing,” he said. His
   team designed new optical elements that could correct the Hubble’s
   flawed vision yet also fit in with the modular instrument design
   philosophy. Cepollina's leading additional successful repair and
   improvement missions for Hubble followed in 1997, 1999 and
   2002.^[101][11] These additional missions enhanced the satellite so
   that the technologies which were not available at the time of Hubble's
   initial deployment, including better [102]cameras, more efficient
   [103]solar arrays, and a more powerful [104]processor for data
   transfer.^[105][12]

[[106]edit] Inventions Applied in Other Fields

   Not only has Cepollina's work benefited the advancement of space
   technology, but it has also led to improvements in several other
   industries including a much more accurate method to detect [107]breast
   cancer that uses technology originally developed for Hubble's charge
   coupled device (CCD).^[108][13] Other improvements are smaller and
   faster microchips created with highly sophisticated Hubble-type
   optics,^[109][14] and manufacturing applications employing an
   intelligent, programmable, hand-held power tool.^[110][15]

[[111]edit] Cepollina as a Team Leader

   In addition to being a successful inventor, Cepollina is also a team
   leader. His work with the Hubble highlights his character as a leader.
   He is currently the manager of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope
   Development Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in
   Greenbelt, Maryland. Among his numerous awards, Cepollina received the
   NASA [112]Outstanding Leadership Medal for the Hubble Space Telescope
   First Servicing Mission.

   In his presentation “The Hubble Experience”,^[113][16] he mentions that
   the success of the Hubble repair mission was due to the harmony among
   the partners of the project. [114]Johnson Space Center, [115]Kennedy
   Space Center, [116]Marshall Space Flight Center, [117]Glenn Research
   Facility, [118]Langley Research Center, [119]Jet Propulsion Labaratory
   of NASA all worked together and shared responsibilities in order to
   repair Hubble. As the team leader, Cepollina was responsible for
   keeping the individual groups in accord, and he managed to do so.

[[120]edit] Awards

   In 1985, Cepollina received a [121]NASA Exceptional Achievement Award
   for leading the Solar Max Repair Mission. For his outstanding
   leadership of the Hubble Space Telescope First Servicing Mission, which
   corrected Hubble's vision, he was awarded a NASA Outstanding Leadership
   Medal, as well as the prestigious 1994 [122]National Space Club Eagle
   Manned Mission Success Award. In April 1995, he received the
   [123]University of Santa Clara Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award
   and was inducted into [124]Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society as an
   Eminent Engineer. In October 1997, Mr. Cepollina was presented with the
   [125]James J. Kerley Award, the top NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center
   Award for innovation and exceptional contributions to NASA’s technology
   transfer and [126]commercialization efforts.

   In 1997, Mr. Cepollina was named a finalist for the [127]Design News
   Engineer of the Year Award. In April 1998, he received the
   distinguished [128]Federal Laboratory Consortium Award for Excellence
   in Technology Transfer. In February 2000, he was awarded Goddard Space
   Flight Center's highest honor for mission success, the [129]Robert C.
   Baumann Memorial Award. In 1999, he and his team received the
   [130]Aviation Week & Space Technology Laurels Award for Outstanding
   Achievement. In 2000, the [131]President of the United States of
   America conferred upon Mr. Cepollina the rank of [132]Meritorious
   Executive in Senior Executive Service for his sustained, superior
   accomplishments in managing NASA programs. He and the entire Hubble
   Space Telescope Team won the prestigious 2001 [133]Space Foundation
   Space Achievement Award. In 2003, he was inducted to the [134]National
   Inventor's Hall of Fame for satellite servicing
   techniques.^[135][17]^[136][18]
