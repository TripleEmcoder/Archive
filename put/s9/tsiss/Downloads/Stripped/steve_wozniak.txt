   Stephen Gary "Woz" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950 in [18]San Jose,
   [19]California) is an [20]American [21]computer engineer who co-founded
   Apple Computer, Inc. (now [22]Apple Inc.) with [23]Steve Jobs and
   [24]Ronald Wayne. His inventions and machines are credited with
   contributing significantly to the [25]personal computer revolution of
   the 1970s. Wozniak created the [26]Apple I and [27]Apple II computers
   in the mid-1970s.^[28][1]

   Wozniak has several [29]nicknames, including "The Woz", "Wonderful
   Wizard of Woz" and "iWoz" (a reference to the ubiquitous naming scheme
   for Apple products). "WoZ" (short for "[30]Wheels of Zeus") is also the
   name of a company Wozniak founded. He is sometimes known as the "Other
   Steve" of Apple Computer, the better known Steve being co-founder
   [31]Steve Jobs. He has Polish ancestry.^[32][2]

[[50]edit] Apple Computer

[[51]edit] Origins of Apple

   In 1970, Wozniak became friends with Steve Jobs, when Jobs had a summer
   job at the same business where Wozniak was working on a [52]mainframe
   computer.^[53][3] According to Wozniak's autobiography, [54]iWoz, Jobs
   had the idea to sell the computer as a fully assembled [55]printed
   circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs
   that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their
   grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of
   their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP [56]scientific calculator and
   Jobs' [57]Volkswagen van), raised [58]USD $1,300, and assembled the
   first prototypes in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space
   left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with
   monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had
   developed, similar to SuperPong but with voice overs to the blips on
   the screen. Wozniak carried electronic devices with him often, and
   would entertain party goers with novel devices.^[[59]citation needed]

   By 1975, Wozniak withdrew from the [60]University of California,
   Berkeley and came up with the computer that eventually made him famous
   and some have compared to a work of art since the hardware, circuit
   board designs, and operating system was the work solely of
   Wozniak.^[61][4] With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely
   working to impress other members of the [62]Palo Alto-based
   [63]Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists very
   interested in computing, one of several key centers which established
   the home hobbyist era essentially creating the personal computer
   industry over several years. Unlike other Home Brew competitors, the
   Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that immediately created
   buzz and drew a crowd when it was unveiled.^[64][4]

   On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed [65]Apple Computer. Wozniak
   quit his job at [66]Hewlett-Packard and became the vice president in
   charge of research and development at Apple. Their first product, the
   [67]Apple I computer, was similar to the [68]Altair 8800, the first
   commercially available personal computer, except it had no provision
   for internal expansion cards. With the addition of these cards, the
   Altair could be attached to a computer terminal and could be programmed
   in [69]BASIC. The Apple I was purely a hobbyist machine, a $25
   [70]microprocessor ([71]MOS 6502) on a single-circuit board with 256
   bytes of [72]ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of [73]RAM and a 40 character by 24
   row display controller. It lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, or
   display, which had to be provided by the user. The Apple I was priced
   at $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the correlation
   between the number and the [74]mark of the beast, and "I came up with
   [it] because I like repeating digits." It was $500 plus a 1/3 markup,
   which is actually $666.67, rounding up to the nearest penny.) Jobs and
   Wozniak sold their first 50 computers to [75]Paul Terrell, who was
   starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in [76]Mountain
   View, California. Terrell bought just the circuit board for the
   Apple I; he had to supply the keyboard, monitor, transformer, and even
   the case in which to put the computer.^[77][5]
   Excerpt from the Apple I design manual, including Wozniak's hand-drawn
   diagrams

   Wozniak could now focus full-time on fixing the shortcomings of the
   Apple I and adding new functionality. His new design was to retain the
   most important characteristics: simplicity and usability. Wozniak
   introduced high-resolution graphics in the [78]Apple II.^[79][5] His
   computer could now display pictures instead of just letters: "I threw
   in high-res. It was only two chips. I didn't know if people would use
   it." By 1978, he had also designed an inexpensive disk drive
   controller. He and [80]Randy Wigginton wrote a simple disk operating
   system and file system. [81]Shepardson Microsystems was contracted to
   build a simple command line interface for the disk operating system.

   In addition to designing the hardware, Wozniak wrote most of the
   software initially provided with the Apple. He wrote a programming
   language interpreter, a set of virtual [82]16-bit processor
   instructions known as [83]SWEET 16, a [84]Breakout game (which was also
   a reason to add sound to the computer), the code needed to control the
   disk drive, and more.

   In 1980, Apple [85]went public and made Jobs and Wozniak
   multimillionaires. However, Jobs had refused to allow some employees of
   Apple to receive stock options, so Wozniak decided to share some of his
   [86]founder stock with the rest of the team by either giving them away
   for free or at a heavily discounted price. This was dubbed "The Woz
   Plan".^[87][6]

[[88]edit] Aircraft accident

   In February 1981, Steve Wozniak crashed his [89]Beechcraft Bonanza
   while taking off from [90]Santa Cruz Sky Park. The [91]NTSB
   investigation revealed that Wozniak did not have a "high performance"
   aircraft endorsement (making him legally unqualified to operate the
   airplane), and had a "lack of familiarity with [the] aircraft."^[92][7]
   The cause of the crash was determined to be a premature liftoff,
   followed by a stall and "mush" into a 12-foot embankment. As a result
   of the accident, he had [93]retrograde amnesia and temporary
   [94]anterograde amnesia. He had no recollection of the accident and,
   for a while, did not even know he had been involved in a crash. He also
   did not remember his hospital stays or the things he did after he was
   released: he followed his previous routine (except for flying), but
   could not recall what had happened. He would walk into rooms and forget
   why he was there and couldn't even remember which day it was. For
   example, he would go to work on Sunday, or stay home on a Wednesday,
   thinking it was the weekend.^[95][5] He began to piece together clues
   from what people told him. He asked his girlfriend, Candice Clark (an
   early Apple employee who worked in the accounting department), whether
   he had been involved in an accident of some kind. When she told him
   about the event, his short-term memory was restored; Wozniak also
   credits Apple II [96]computer games for aiding him in restoring those
   lost memories. Wozniak and Clark got engaged later that year.^[97][5]

[[98]edit] Employment with Apple

   Wozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the
   crash. Instead, he married Clark and returned to UC Berkeley under the
   name "[99]Rocky Raccoon Clark" (Rocky was his dog's name and Clark his
   wife's maiden name), finally earning his undergraduate degree in
   1986.^[100][8] In May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak also sponsored two [101]US
   Festivals to celebrate evolving technologies; they ended up as a
   technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music,
   computers, television and people.

   In 1983 he decided to return to Apple product development, but he
   wanted no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational
   factor for the Apple workforce.^[102][5]

   Wozniak permanently ended his full-time employment with Apple on
   February 6, 1987, 12 years after creating the company. He still remains
   an employee (and receives a paycheck)^[103][5]^[104][9] and is a
   shareholder.^[105][10] He also maintains connections with [106]Steve
   Jobs.

[[107]edit] Post-Apple career

   Wozniak founded a new venture called [108]CL 9, which developed and
   brought the first [109]universal remote control to market in
   1987.^[110][5] Wozniak also taught fifth-grade students.

   In 2001, Wozniak co-founded [111]Wheels of Zeus (note the [112]acronym,
   "WoZ"), to create wireless [113]GPS technology to "help everyday people
   find everyday things." In 2002, he joined the Board of Directors of
   [114]Ripcord Networks, Inc., joining [115]Ellen Hancock, [116]Gil
   Amelio, Mike Connor, and [117]Wheels of Zeus co-founder [118]Alex
   Fielding, all Apple alumni, in a new [119]telecommunications venture.
   Later the same year he joined the Board of Directors of [120]Danger,
   Inc., the maker of the [121]Hip Top (a.k.a. Side Kick from T-Mobile).
   [122]Joey Slotnick, left, poses with Steve Wozniak. Slotnick portrayed
   Wozniak in the film [123]Pirates of Silicon Valley.

   In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded [124]Acquicor
   Technology, a [125]holding company for acquiring technology companies
   and developing them, with Apple alumni [126]Ellen Hancock and [127]Gil
   Amelio.

   In September 2006, Wozniak published his autobiography, [128]iWoz: From
   Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer,
   Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It. It was co-authored by writer
   Gina Smith.

   In March 2006, Wozniak attended the [129]FIRST National Competition in
   Atlanta to show off [130]Lego robots.^[131][11] In 2010, he attended
   another FIRST event, a regional event in downtown Phoenix Arizona at
   the [132]Arizona State Fairgrounds.

   In February 2009 Steve Wozniak joined [133]Fusion-io, a data storage
   and server company, in [134]Salt Lake City, [135]Utah as their chief
   scientist.^[136][12]

   On November 18, 2010 Steve Wozniak gave a speech at the Science &
   Technology Summit at the [137]World Forum Convention Center in [138]The
   Hague in which he predicted that Android would be dominant over the
   iPhone market-wise but the iPhone would retain the quality
   edge.^[139][13]

[[140]edit] Philanthropy

   Since leaving Apple, Wozniak has provided all the money, as well as a
   good amount of on-site technical support, for the technology program in
   his local school district.^[141][5] Un.U.Son. (Unite Us In Song), an
   organization Wozniak formed to organize the two US Festivals, is now
   primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic
   projects.^[142][5] In 1986, Wozniak lent his name to the Stephen G.
   Wozniak Achievement Awards (referred to as Wozzie Awards), which he
   presented to six Bay Area high school and college students for their
   innovative use of computers in the fields of business, art and music.

[[143]edit] Honors and awards

   Wozniak received the [144]National Medal of Technology in 1985 (with
   [145]Steve Jobs) from [146]Ronald Reagan, the [147]President of the
   United States^[148][5] at that time. In December 1989, he received an
   honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the [149]University of
   Colorado at Boulder, where he studied in the late sixties.^[150][14]
   Later he donated funds to create the "Woz Lab" at the [151]University
   of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, he was named a Fellow of the
   [152]Computer History Museum. Wozniak was a key contributor and
   benefactor to the [153]Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose (the
   street in front of the museum has been renamed Woz Way in his
   honor).^[154][15]

   In September 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the [155]National
   Inventors Hall of Fame,^[156][16] and in 2001 he was awarded the 7th
   Annual [157]Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and
   Employment.^[158][17]

   In December 2005, Wozniak was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering
   degree from [159]Kettering University, in [160]Flint,
   [161]Michigan.^[162][18] He also received an honorary degree from
   [163]North Carolina State University, [164]Nova Southeastern
   University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and the Telluride Tech Festival
   Award of Technology.

[[165]edit] Patents

   Wozniak is listed as the sole inventor on the following patents:
     * US Patent No. 4,136,359 - "Microcomputer for use with video
       display"^[166][19] - for which he was inducted into the National
       Inventors Hall of Fame.
     * US Patent No. 4,210,959 - "Controller for magnetic disc, recorder,
       or the like"^[167][20]
     * US Patent No. 4,217,604 - "Apparatus for digitally controlling
       [168]PAL color display"^[169][21]
     * US Patent No. 4,278,972 - "Digitally-controlled color signal
       generation means for use with display"^[170][22]

[[171]edit] Television appearances

   After seeing her stand-up performance in Saratoga, California, Wozniak
   began dating comedian [172]Kathy Griffin.^[173][23] Together, they
   attended the [174]2007 Emmy Awards,^[175][24] and he subsequently made
   many appearances on the fourth season of her show [176]Kathy Griffin:
   My Life on the D-List. Woz is on the show as her date for the
   [177]Producers Guild of America award show. However, on a June 19, 2008
   appearance on [178]The Howard Stern Show, Griffin confirmed that they
   are no longer dating and have decided to remain friends.^[179][25]

   Wozniak portrays a parody of himself in the first episode of the
   television series [180]Code Monkeys; he plays the owner of Gameavision
   before selling it to help fund Apple. He later appears again in the
   twelfth episode when he is in [181]Las Vegas at the annual Video Game
   Convention and sees Dave and Jerry. He also appears in a parody of the
   "Get a Mac" ads featured in the final episode of Code Monkeys' second
   season. Wozniak is also interviewed and featured in the documentary
   [182]Hackers Wanted and on BBC.

   Wozniak competed on Season 8 of [183]Dancing with the Stars in
   2009^[184][26]^[185][27] where he danced with [186]Karina Smirnoff.
   Despite Wozniak and Smirnoff receiving 10 combined points from the
   three judges out of 30, the lowest score of the evening, he remained in
   the competition. He later posted on a [187]social networking site that
   he felt that the vote count was not legitimate and suggested that the
   Dancing with the Stars judges had lied about the vote count to keep him
   on the show.^[188][28] After being briefed on the method of judging and
   vote counting, he retracted and apologized for his
   statements.^[189][29] Despite suffering a pulled [190]hamstring and a
   fracture in his foot, Wozniak continued to compete,^[191][30] but was
   eliminated from the competition on March 31, with a score of 12 out of
   30 for an [192]Argentine Tango.^[193][31]

   On September 30, 2010 he appeared as himself on [194]The Big Bang
   Theory dining in [195]The Cheesecake Factory where Penny works and is
   approached by a robot Sheldon. Leonard tries to explain to Penny who
   Steve is, but she says she knows him from Dancing with the Stars.
   Steve Wozniak signs a [196]Modbook for a fan during an appearance at
   the Axiotron booth during [197]Macworld Expo 2009.

[[198]edit] Personal life

   Wozniak lives in [199]Los Gatos, California. He is a member of a
   [200]Segway Polo team, the Silicon Valley Aftershocks. In 2006, they
   were challenged to a game by the newly formed New Zealand Pole Blacks
   (the Woz Challenge Cup); the match ended in a 2-2 tie, with the Woz
   Challenge Cup staying in Auckland. In 2007, the Silicon Valley
   Aftershocks avenged the tie by defeating the Pole Blacks 5-0 in the Woz
   Challenge Cup finals. The 2008 Woz Challenge Cup was held at the
   SegwayFesT 2008 in Indianapolis, Indiana from 8–10 August 2008 (polo
   events ran 7–9 August 2008).^[201][32]

   His favorite video game is [202]Tetris.^[203][33] In the 1990s he
   submitted so many high scores for the game to [204]Nintendo Power that
   they would no longer print his scores, so he started sending them in
   under the alphabetically reversed "Evets Kainzow".^[205][34]

   He is also a sworn member of the [206]Freemasons. Wozniak describes his
   impetus for joining the Freemasons as being able to spend more time
   with his wife at the time, Alice. Alice belonged to the [207]Order of
   the Eastern Star, associated with the Masons. He says that although he
   took the necessary oaths and is a lifetime Freemason, he doesn't
   actually put a whole lot of stock in the mystical and religious
   overtones of the oath or the order. He says that he joined the
   Freemasons for one specific purpose, but he is very unlike the other
   members of the order. He says he quickly rose to a third degree
   Freemason because, whatever he does, he tries to do well. He was
   initiated in 1980 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in Campbell,
   California.^[208][35]

   He is married to Janet Hill.^[209][36] According to his ex-girlfriend
   [210]Kathy Griffin, “He met someone very quickly and then they [got]
   engaged. I have had dinner with them, and she’s a thousand times more
   appropriate!”^[211][37]
