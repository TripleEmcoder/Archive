   Walter E. Diemer (8 January 1904—9 January 1998) was an accountant and
   inventor of [11]bubble gum.

   Born and raised in [12]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, 23 year old
   Diemer was working as an accountant at [13]Fleer in 1926 when the
   company president sought to cut costs by making their own gum base.
   (Founder [14]Frank Henry Fleer had made a batch of bubble gum in 1906
   which he called Blibber Blubber, but it was too sticky and broke too
   easily.)

   Although an accountant by trade, Mr. Diemer liked to experiment with
   gum recipes in his spare time. In doing so, he accidentally stumbled
   upon a recipe that was totally unique. The gum was pink because it was
   the only food coloring in the factory, which is why most gum today is
   pink.^[15][1]

   It was less sticky (would not stick to the face) than standard chewing
   gum yet stretched more easily. He saw the possibilities and using a
   [16]salt water taffy wrapping machine, wrapped one hundred pieces of
   the creation to test market in a local [17]mom-and-pop [18]candy store.
   They sold out in one day priced at one penny a piece.

   Fleer began marketing the new gum as "[19]Dubble Bubble" and Diemer
   himself taught salesmen to blow bubbles. This helped them to
   demonstrate how Dubble Bubble differed from all other chewing gums.

   Sales surpasses [20]US$ 1.5 million in the first year, at a penny a
   piece. Diemer did not [21]patent his invention, and soon competition
   arose as bubble gum became a popular inexpensive treat during the
   [22]Great Depression.

   According to his second wife, Florence, Walter Diemer never received
   royalties for his invention but he didn't mind. She also said he
   oversaw construction of bubble gum plants in Philadelphia and
   [23]Barcelona, Spain, and travelled around the world marketing the gum.
   He stayed with Fleer for decades, eventually reaching the position of
   senior vice president as well as a member of the Board of Directors of
   Fleer Corporation. He retired in 1970, and remained on the board for 15
   more years. Following the death of his first wife Adelaide in 1990,
   Diemer rode around his Pennsylvania retirement village in a big
   tricycle, distributing bubble gum to children.^[24][2]

   He died of [25]congestive heart failure, four days after his 94th
   birthday.^[26][3]
