   Edwin Howard Armstrong (December 18, 1890 – January 31, 1954) was an
   American [20]electrical engineer and [21]inventor. Armstrong was the
   inventor of modern [22]frequency modulation (FM) radio.

   Edwin Howard Armstrong was born in New York City, New York, in 1890. He
   studied at [23]Columbia University and later became a professor there.
   He invented the [24]regenerative circuit while he was an undergraduate
   and [25]patented it in 1914, the super-regenerative circuit (patented
   1922), and the [26]superheterodyne receiver (patented 1918).^[27][2]

[[40]edit] Early life

   Armstrong was born in the [41]Chelsea district of [42]New York City to
   John and Emily Armstrong.^[43][1] The family moved in 1902 to
   [44]Yonkers. He showed an interest in electrical and mechanical
   devices, particularly trains, from an early age.^[45][3]

   He loved heights and constructed a makeshift radio antenna tower in his
   back yard. Swinging on a bosun's chair, he would hoist himself up and
   down the tower to the concern of his neighbors. A case of rheumatic
   fever as a child left him with a tic in one eye.

   In late 1917, Armstrong was invited to join the [46]U.S. Army Signal
   Corps as a captain and was sent to Paris to help set up a wireless
   communication system for the Army. He returned to the United States in
   the fall of 1919.^[47][3]

   During his service in two world wars, Armstrong gave the U.S. military
   free use of his patents. Use of these patents was critical to Allied
   victory during the wars.

   Unlike many engineers, Armstrong was never a corporate employee. He
   performed research and development on his own and owned his patents
   outright. He did not subscribe to conventional wisdom and was quick to
   question the opinions of his professors and his peers.

[[48]edit] Work and patent disputes

   Howard Armstrong contributed the most to modern electronics technology.
   His discoveries revolutionized electronic communications.
   [49]Regeneration, or amplification via [50]positive feedback is still
   in use to this day. Also, Armstrong discovered that [51]Lee De Forest's
   [52]Audion would go into [53]oscillation when feedback was increased.
   Thus, the Audion could not only detect and amplify radio signals, it
   could transmit them as well.

   While De Forest's addition of a third element to the [54]Audion (the
   grid) and the subsequent move to modulated (voice) radio is not
   disputed, De Forest did not put his device to work. Armstrong's
   research and experimentation with the Audion moved radio reception
   beyond the crystal set and spark-gap transmitters. Radio signals could
   be amplified via regeneration to the point of human hearing without a
   headset. Armstrong later published a paper detailing how the Audion
   worked,^[55][4] something De Forest could not do. De Forest did not
   understand the workings of his Audion.

   Armstrong's discovery and development of [56]superheterodyne technology
   made radio receivers, then the primary communications devices of the
   time, more sensitive and selective. Before heterodyning, radio signals
   often overrode and interfered with each other. Heterodyning also made
   radio receivers much easier to use, rendering obsolete the multitude of
   tuning controls on radio sets of the time. The superheterodyne
   technology is still used today.

   Armstrong is possibly best known for his discovery of wide-band
   [57]frequency modulation. FM was born of a request by [58]David Sarnoff
   of [59]RCA as a means to eliminate static in radio reception. While
   Sarnoff was understandably impressed with Armstrong's FM system, he
   also understood that it was not compatible with his own AM empire.
   Sarnoff came to see FM as a threat and refused to support it further.

   Many of Armstrong's inventions were ultimately claimed by others in
   patent lawsuits. In particular, the regenerative circuit, which
   Armstrong patented in 1914 as a "wireless receiving system," was
   subsequently patented by [60]Lee De Forest in 1916; De Forest then sold
   the rights to his patent to [61]AT&T. Between 1922 and 1934, Armstrong
   found himself embroiled in a patent war, between himself, [62]RCA, and
   [63]Westinghouse on one side, and De Forest and AT&T on the other. At
   the time, this action was the longest patent lawsuit ever litigated, at
   12 years. Armstrong won the first round of the lawsuit, lost the
   second, and stalemated in a third. Before the [64]Supreme Court of the
   United States, De Forest was granted the regeneration patent in what is
   today widely believed to be a misunderstanding of the technical facts
   by the Supreme Court.^[65][5]

   By early 1923, Armstrong was a millionaire as a result of licensing his
   patents to RCA.^[66][3]

   In 1946 the FCC's decision to use Armstrong's FM system as the standard
   for [67]NTSC television sound gave Armstrong another chance at royalty
   payments. However, RCA refused to pay royalties and encouraged other
   television makers not to pay them either.

[[68]edit] FM radio

   Columbia's Philosophy Hall. Armstrong developed FM radio in its
   basement laboratory.

   Even as the regenerative-circuit lawsuit continued, Armstrong was
   working on another momentous invention. While working in the basement
   laboratory of Columbia's [69]Philosophy Hall, he created wide-band
   [70]frequency modulation radio (FM). Rather than varying the amplitude
   of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied the
   frequency of the wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much
   clearer sound, free of static, than the [71]AM radio dominant at the
   time. (Armstrong received a patent on wide-band FM on December 26,
   1933.^[72][6]

   In 1922, [73]John Renshaw Carson of AT&T, inventor of
   [74]Single-sideband modulation (SSB modulation), had published a paper
   in the [75]Proceedings of the IRE arguing that FM did not appear to
   offer any particular advantage.^[76][7] Armstrong managed to
   demonstrate the advantages of FM radio despite Carson's skepticism in a
   now-famous paper on FM in the Proceedings of the IRE in 1936,^[77][8]
   which was reprinted in the August 1984 issue of [78]Proceedings of the
   IEEE.^[79][9]

   Today the consensus regarding FM is that narrow band FM is not so
   advantageous in terms of noise reduction, but wide band FM can bring
   great improvement in [80]signal to noise ratio if the signal is
   stronger than a certain threshold. Hence Carson was not entirely wrong,
   and the [81]Carson bandwidth rule for FM is still important today.
   Thus, both Carson and Armstrong ultimately contributed significantly to
   the science and technology of radio. The threshold concept was
   discussed by Murray G. Crosby (inventor of [82]Crosby system for FM
   Stereo) who pointed out that for wide band FM to provide better signal
   to noise ratio, the signal should be above a certain threshold,
   according to his paper published in Proceedings of the IRE in
   1937.^[83][10] Thus Crosby's work supplemented Armstrong's paper in
   1936.

   Armstrong conducted the first large scale field tests of his FM radio
   technology on the 85th floor of [84]RCA's (Radio Corporation of
   America) [85]Empire State Building from May 1934 until October 1935.
   However RCA had its eye on television broadcasting, and chose not to
   buy the patents for the FM technology.^[86][11] A June 17, 1936,
   presentation at the [87]Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
   headquarters made headlines nationwide. He played a jazz record over
   conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM broadcast. "[I]f the
   audience of 50 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed
   the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds,"
   noted one reporter. He added that several engineers described the
   invention "as one of the most important radio developments since the
   first earphone crystal sets were introduced."^[88][12]

   In 1937, Armstrong financed construction of the first FM radio station,
   [89]W2XMN, a 40 kilowatt broadcaster in [90]Alpine, New Jersey. The
   signal (at 42.8 MHz) could be heard clearly 100 miles (160 km) away,
   despite the use of less power than an AM radio station.^[91][13]

   RCA began to [92]lobby for a change in the law or FCC regulations that
   would prevent FM radios from becoming dominant. By June 1945, the RCA
   had pushed the FCC hard on the allocation of electromagnetic
   frequencies for the fledgling television industry. Although they denied
   wrongdoing, [93]David Sarnoff and RCA managed to get the FCC to move
   the FM radio spectrum from (42-50 MHz), to (88-108 MHz), while getting
   new low-powered community television stations allocated to a new
   Channel 1 in the 44-50 MHz range. In fairness to the FCC, the 42-50 MHz
   band was plagued by frequent tropospheric and E-layer stratospheric
   propagation which caused distant high powered stations to interfere
   with each other. The problem becomes even more severe on a cyclical
   basis when sunspot levels reach a maximum every 11 years and lower VHF
   band signals below 50 MHz can travel across the Atlantic Ocean or from
   coast to coast within North America on occasion. Sunspot levels were
   near their cyclical peak when the FCC reallocated FM in 1945. The
   88-108 MHz range is a technically better location for FM broadcast
   because it is less susceptible to this kind of frequent interference.
   (Channel 1 eventually had to be deleted as well, with all TV broadcasts
   licensed at frequencies 54 MHz or higher, and the band is no longer
   widely used for emergency first responders either, those services
   having moved mostly to UHF.)

   But the immediate economic impact of the shift, whatever its technical
   merit, was devastating to early FM broadcasters. This single FCC action
   would render all Armstrong-era FM receivers useless within a short time
   as stations were moved to the new band, and it also protected both
   RCA's AM-radio stronghold and that of the other major competing
   networks, CBS, ABC and Mutual. Armstrong's radio network did not
   survive the shift into the high frequencies and was set back by the FCC
   decision. This change was strongly supported by [94]AT&T, because loss
   of FM relaying stations forced radio stations to buy wired links from
   AT&T.

   Furthermore, RCA also claimed invention of FM radio and won its own
   patent on the technology. A patent fight between RCA and Armstrong
   ensued. RCA's momentous victory in the courts left Armstrong unable to
   claim royalties on any FM receivers, including televisions, sold in the
   United States. The undermining of the [95]Yankee Network and his costly
   legal battles brought ruin to Armstrong, by then almost penniless and
   emotionally distraught. Eventually, after Armstrong's death, many of
   the lawsuits were decided or settled in his favor, greatly enriching
   his estate and heirs—but the decisions came too late for Armstrong
   himself to enjoy his legal vindication.

[[96]edit] Personal life

   Armstrong married Sarnoff's secretary, Marion MacInnis, in December
   1922. He gave Marion the world's first portable radio as a wedding
   gift. Armstrong bought a [97]Hispano-Suiza motor car before the
   wedding, which they drove to [98]Palm Beach, Florida for their
   honeymoon. He kept the car until his death. He was an avid tennis
   player until an injury in 1940, and drank an [99]Old Fashioned with
   dinner.^[100][3]

[[101]edit] Death

   Financially broken and mentally beaten after years of legal tussles
   with RCA and others, Armstrong lashed out at his wife with a fireplace
   poker, striking her on the arm. Fearing for her life, Marion fled their
   apartment and went to stay with her sister. Alone and depressed over
   the FM patent disputes, Armstrong removed the air conditioner from the
   window, dressed in his coat and hat and jumped to his death from the
   thirteenth floor of his New York City apartment on January 31, 1954.
   His body was found the next morning by a maintenance worker. His
   suicide note to his wife read: "May God help you and have mercy on my
   soul".^[102][14]^[103][15] Upon hearing the news, [104]David Sarnoff
   remarked "I did not kill Armstrong." Amstrong's widow Marion renewed
   the patent fight against RCA and finally prevailed. Unlike her husband,
   Marion was willing to compromise.^[105][16]^[106][17]

[[107]edit] Legacy

   It took decades following Armstrong's death for [108]FM broadcasting to
   meet and surpass the saturation of the AM band, and longer still for FM
   radio to become profitable for broadcasters. Two developments made a
   difference in the 1960s. One was the development of true stereophonic
   broadcasting on FM by General Electric, which resulted in the approval
   of an FM stereo broadcast standard by the FCC in 1961, and the
   conversion of hundreds of stations to stereo within a few years.

   The other was an FCC rulemaking in 1966 that required broadcasters who
   owned both fulltime AM stations and FM properties in the same city to
   program each of them with separate programming during a majority of the
   day. This meant FM no longer just simulcast AM with better sound
   quality, but offered unique program choices expanding what listeners
   could hear. Programmers took advantage by turning their FM stations
   into venues for formats from country to progressive rock to jazz and
   classical music, all with the enhanced quality that stereo sound could
   bring. For example, some AM stations paused Sunday morning music
   programming for religious voicetracks by ministers. Sister stations on
   FM continued the music programming.

   Within a few years a majority of households were FM equipped, by the
   1980s a majority of cars sold had FM stereo radios and a majority of
   listening in the U.S. was devoted to FM signals according to the
   Arbitron rating service. The stereo sound revolution, followed by the
   programming revolution, accomplished what cleaner and crisper sound
   alone was unable to achieve, and made FM radio a permanent and
   important part of the communications landscape.

   Armstrong was of the opinion that anyone who had actual contact with
   the [109]development of radio understood that the radio art was the
   product of [110]experiment and work based on [111]physical reasoning,
   rather than on the [112]mathematicians' [113]calculations and
   [114]formulae (known today as part of "[115]mathematical physics"). His
   work, as important as it was in its own right, was a part of a
   continuum of progress in communications and electronics that since his
   time has brought forward color television, the personal computer, the
   Internet, cable and satellite radio and TV, personal mobile phones,
   audio, video and computing, digital stereo radio on both the medium
   wave and VHF-FM bands, and digital high definition television on VHF,
   UHF, cable and satellite. Armstrong's FM system was used for
   communications between [116]NASA and the [117]Apollo program
   astronauts.

[[118]edit] Honors

   Armstrong's house, circa 1975. It was demolished in 1983 due to fire
   damage.

   In 1917 Armstrong was the first recipient of the [119]IRE's, now
   [120]IEEE Medal of Honor. For his wartime work on radio the French
   government gave him the [121]Legion of Honor in 1919. He was awarded
   the 1941 [122]Franklin Medal. He received in 1942 the [123]AIEEs
   [124]Edison Medal "for distinguished contributions to the art of
   electric communication, notably the regenerative circuit, the
   superheterodyne, and frequency modulation". The [125]ITU added him to
   its roster of great inventors of electricity in 1955. In 1980 he was
   inducted into the [126]National Inventors Hall of Fame, and was on a
   U.S. [127]postage stamp in 1983. The [128]Consumer Electronics Hall of
   Fame inducted him in 2000, "in recognition of his contributions and
   pioneering spirit that have laid the foundation for consumer
   electronics."

   Philosophy Hall, the Columbia building where Armstrong developed FM,
   was declared a [129]National Historic Landmark in 2003 in recognition
   of that fact. [130]Armstrong's home in [131]Yonkers also received
   designation in both the NHL and the [132]National Register of Historic
   Places, but both were withdrawn when the house was later
   [133]demolished.^[134][18]^[135][19]

   Armstrong Hall at Columbia is also named in his honor. The building, at
   the northeast corner of [136]Broadway and 112th Street, was originally
   an apartment house but was converted to research space after Columbia
   bought it. It is now home to the [137]Goddard Institute for Space
   Studies, a research institute jointly operated by Columbia and the
   [138]National Aeronautics and Space Administration dedicated to
   atmospheric and climate science. A storefront in the corner of the
   building houses [139]Tom's Restaurant, a longtime neighborhood fixture
   that was featured as the fictional diner "Monk's" for establishing
   shots in the television series "[140]Seinfeld". The same restaurant
   also inspired [141]Susanne Vega's song "[142]Tom's Diner".

   In addition, Columbia established the Edwin Howard Armstrong
   [143]Professorship in [144]Computer Science in Armstrong's memory.
