                   Harold Stephen Black
        Born      April 14, 1898(1898-04-14)
                  [7]Leominster, Massachusetts
        Died      December 11, 1983(1983-12-11) (aged 85)
    Nationality   [8]United States
       Fields     [9]Electrical engineer
   [10]Alma mater [11]Worcester Polytechnic Institute
     Known for    [12]negative feedback

   Harold Stephen Black (April 14, 1898 – December 11, 1983) was an
   American [13]electrical engineer, who revolutionized the field of
   applied electronics by inventing the [14]negative feedback amplifier in
   1927. To some, his invention is considered the most important
   breakthrough of the twentieth century in the field of [15]electronics,
   since it has a wide area of application. This is because all electronic
   devices (vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors and MOS transistors)
   invented by mankind are basically nonlinear devices. It is the
   invention of negative feedback which makes highly linear amplifiers
   possible. Negative feedback basically works by sacrificing gain for
   higher linearity (or in other words, smaller [16]distortion or smaller
   [17]intermodulation). By sacrificing gain, it also has an additional
   effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier. However, a
   negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate.
   Once the stability problem is solved, the negative feedback amplifier
   is extremely useful in the field of electronics. Black published a
   famous paper, Stabilized feedback amplifiers, in 1934.

[[22]edit] Biography

   He was born in [23]Leominster, Massachusetts in 1898. He went to
   [24]Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) for his first degree.
   Subsequently, he received the B.S.E.E. degree from WPI in 1921 and then
   joined [25]Western Electric, which was the manufacturing arm of AT&T.
   He joined [26]Bell Labs (1925), where he was a member of technical
   staff until his retirement (1963).

   Black started writing his autobiography with the tentative title
   "Before the ferry docked".^[27][1] However, he died in December 1983 at
   age 85 before he could finish it.

[[28]edit] Work

   Amplifiers are non-linear, therefore every time a signal is amplified
   in a telecommunications network, which can happen dozens of times on a
   circuit, noise and distortion are added. Black first invented the
   feed-forward amplifier which compares the input and output signals and
   then negatively amplifies the distortion and combines the two signals,
   canceling out some of the distortion. This improved amplifier design
   but did not solve the problems of transcontinental telecommunication.
   ^[29][2]

   After years of work Black invented the negative feedback amplifier
   which uses negative feedback to reduce the gain of a high-gain,
   non-linear amplifier and makes it act as a low-gain, linear amplifier
   with much lower noise and distortion. The Negative feedback amplifier
   allowed Bell system to reduce overcrowding of lines and extend its
   long-distance network by means of carrier telephony. It enabled the
   design of accurate fire-control systems in World War II, and it formed
   the basis of early [30]operational amplifiers, as well as precise,
   variable-frequency audio oscillators. ^[31][3]

   According to Black^[32][4] he got his inspiration to invent the
   negative feedback amplifier when he was traveling from [33]New Jersey
   to [34]New York City by taking a ferry to cross the [35]Hudson River in
   August 1927. Having nothing to write on he sketched his thoughts on a
   misprinted page of the New York Times and then signed and dated it.
   ^[36][5] At that time, [37]Bell Laboratories headquarters were located
   in 463 West Street, [38]Manhattan, [39]New York City instead of New
   Jersey and he lived in New Jersey such that he took the ferry every
   morning to go to work.

   Fifty years after his 1927 invention, he published an article in IEEE
   Spectrum regarding the historical background of his invention.^[40][4]
   He published a classical paper on [41]negative feedback amplifier in
   1934,^[42][6] which has been re-printed in the Proceedings of IEEE two
   times in 1984 and 1999^[43][7]^[44][8] Inside his 1934 classical paper
   "Stabilized feed-back amplifiers", he mentioned [45]Harry Nyquist's
   work on stability criterion because a negative feedback amplifier can
   be unstable and oscillate. Thus, with the help of Nyquist's theory, he
   managed to demonstrate a stable negative feedback amplifier which can
   be used in reality. Bernard Friedland wrote an introduction for the
   1999 re-print in Proc. IEEE.^[46][9] James E. Brittain wrote about him
   in 1997.^[47][1]^[48][4] An obituary regarding Black was published by
   IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control in 1984.^[49][10]

   He has also worked on [50]pulse code modulation. He wrote a book on
   "Modulation Theory" ([51]Van Nostrand, 1953). He held many patents the
   most famous of which was US Patent 2,102,671 "Wave Translation System",
   which was issued to Bell Laboratories in 1937, covering the negative
   feedback amplifier.^[52][11]
