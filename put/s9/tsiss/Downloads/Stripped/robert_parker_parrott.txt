   Robert Parker Parrott (October 5, 1804 – December 24, 1877) was an
   [11]American soldier and inventor of military ordnance.

[[12]edit] Biography

   Born in [13]Lee, New Hampshire, he was the son of [14]John Fabyan
   Parrott. He graduated with honors from the [15]United States Military
   Academy, third in the Class of 1824. Parrott was assigned to the Third
   Regiment of [16]Artillery as a [17]second lieutenant. He remained at
   West Point as an instructor until 1829, then saw garrison duty and
   served as a staff officer in operations against the [18]Creek Indians
   early in 1836 before moving to [19]Washington, D.C. in July as Captain
   of Ordnance. He resigned from the army four months later to become the
   superintendent the [20]West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in [21]Cold
   Spring, New York, with which he would be associated for the remainder
   of his life. In 1839 he married Mary Kemble, daughter of [22]Gouverneur
   Kemble, founder of the ironworks.

   While employed at West Point, he and his brother [23]Peter Parrott also
   participated in the operation of the Kemble-owned furnaces in
   [24]Orange County, New York. The brothers purchased a 1/3 interest in
   Greenwood Furnace from a minority holder in 1837, and bought it
   entirely from the Kembles in 1839.

   In 1860, he produced the [25]Parrott rifle, an innovative rifled gun
   which was manufactured in several sizes. The largest, the 300-pounder
   version weighed 26,000 lb (11,800 kg), and its projectile weighed
   300 lb (140 kg). Parrott rifles were extensively employed in the
   [26]American Civil War by both the [27]Union and [28]Confederate
   armies.

   In 1867, Parrott left his superintendency at the West Point Foundry to
   concentrate on the ironworks in Orange County. However, he continued to
   experiment with artillery shells and fuses at West Point until his
   death at Cold Spring at the age of 73.

   The Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance memorialized Parrott: "The staunch
   friend, the Christian gentleman, the soul of honor, not one of all the
   virtues that keep green the memory of the dead can be denied him; but
   above all it can be written on his tomb—he was a good man."
