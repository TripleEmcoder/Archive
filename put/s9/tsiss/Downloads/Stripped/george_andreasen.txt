   George F. Andreasen (February 16, 1934 – August 11, 1989) was an
   American orthodontist and [18]inventor.

   Adnreasen was born February 16, 1934 in [19]Fremont, Nebraska.

   Andreasen, most noted for his invention and patent of the [20]Nitinol
   Wire, also known as Memory Wire or [21]shape memory alloy, began his
   experimentation with the [22]nickel-[23]titanium (NiTi) alloys as early
   as 1969. His idea for Nitonal came from an article he read in the
   United States Naval laboratory publication supplement in the Journal of
   American Orthodontics. Over the course of the next seven years,
   Andreasen experimented with his formula until he reached his goal and
   was awarded U.S. Pat. No. 4,037,324 on July 26, 1979. To this day, this
   is the highest earning patent fostered by the [24]University of Iowa
   College of Orthodontics^[[25]citation needed].

   Dr Andreasen joined the University of Iowa Orthodontics department in
   1963 and was chairman of the orthodontics department from 1965 to 1975.
   He held degrees in mechanical engineering and in dentistry from
   [26]Oxford University and the [27]University of Nebraska. He was a
   diplomat of the American Board of Orthodontics. Dr. Andreasen died on
   August 11, 1989 of [28]multiple myeloma at the age of 55.
