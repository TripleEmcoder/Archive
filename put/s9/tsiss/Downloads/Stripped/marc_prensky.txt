   Marc Prensky (born March 15, 1946 in [20]New York City) is an
   [21]American [22]writer and [23]speaker on learning and education. He
   is best known as the inventor and popularizer of the terms "[24]digital
   native" and "digital immigrant" which he described in a 2001 article in
   "On the Horizon". Prensky's professional focus is on helping reform
   K-12 education, particularly by helping teachers change their pedagogy
   in ways that are more effective for 21st century students and by
   advocating for a change to a passion led,
   problem-solving-methodology-based curriculum. He is an advocate for the
   students in the educational process, and has initiated educator-student
   dialogs about the teaching process around the world. Prensky holds
   degrees from [25]Oberlin College (1966), [26]Yale University (1968) and
   the [27]Harvard Business School (1980). He is the author of "Digital
   Game-Based Learning" ([28]McGraw-Hill 2001), "Don't Bother Me Mom - I'm
   Learning" (Paragon House 2006) and over 60 essays on learning and
   education.
