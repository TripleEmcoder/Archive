   Charles Augustus Lindbergh (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974)
   (nicknamed "Slim,"^[19][1] "Lucky Lindy" and "The Lone Eagle") was an
   American aviator, author, inventor, explorer, and social activist.

   Lindbergh, then a 25-year old U.S. Air Mail pilot, emerged from virtual
   obscurity to almost instantaneous world fame as the result of his
   [20]Orteig Prize-winning solo [21]non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927,
   from [22]Roosevelt Field^[23][N 1] located in [24]Garden City on New
   York's [25]Long Island to [26]Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a
   distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km),^[27][2] in the
   single-seat, single-engine [28]monoplane [29]Spirit of St. Louis.
   Lindbergh, a [30]U.S. Army reserve officer, was also awarded the
   nation's highest military decoration, the [31]Medal of Honor, for his
   historic exploit.^[32][3]

   In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lindbergh relentlessly used his fame
   to help promote the rapid development of U.S. commercial aviation. In
   March 1932, however, his infant son, Charles, Jr., [33]was kidnapped
   and murdered in what was soon dubbed the [34]"Crime of the Century"
   which eventually led to the Lindbergh family fleeing the United States
   in December 1935 to live in Europe where they remained until the
   surprise [35]attack on Pearl Harbor by the [36]Imperial Japanese Navy.
   Before the United States formally entered [37]World War II by declaring
   war on Japan on December 8, 1941, Lindbergh had been an outspoken
   advocate of keeping the U.S. out of the world conflict, as was his
   Congressman father, [38]Charles August Lindbergh (R-MN), during
   [39]World War I, and became a leader of the anti-war [40]America First
   movement. Nonetheless, he supported the war effort after Pearl Harbor
   and flew many combat missions in the [41]Pacific Theater of World War
   II as a civilian consultant, even though President [42]Franklin D.
   Roosevelt had refused to reinstate his Army Air Corps colonel's
   commission that he had resigned in April 1941.

   In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific prize-winning author,
   international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.^[43][4]

[[75]edit] Early years

   Charles A. Lindbergh: son and father c. 1910

   Charles Augustus Lindbergh was born in [76]Detroit, Michigan, on
   February 4, 1902, but spent most of his childhood in [77]Little Falls,
   Minnesota, and Washington, D.C.. He was the only child of Swedish
   native [78]Charles August Lindbergh ([79]birth name Carl Månsson)
   (1859–1924), and Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876–1954), of
   Detroit.^[80][5] The elder Lindbergh was a [81]U.S. Congressman
   ([82]R-[83]MN 6th) from 1907 to 1917 who gained notoriety when he
   opposed the entry of the U.S. into World War I.^[84][6] Mrs. Lindbergh
   was a teacher at [85]Cass Technical High School in Detroit and later at
   Little Falls (MN) High School from which Charles was graduated in 1918.
   Lindbergh also attended over a dozen other schools from Washington,
   D.C., to California during his childhood and teenage years (none for
   more than one full year) including the Force School and [86]Sidwell
   Friends School while living in Washington, D.C., with his
   father,^[87][7] and [88]Redondo Union High School in [89]Redondo Beach,
   California.^[90][8] The Lindberghs separated in 1909.

[[91]edit] Early aviation career

   Lincoln Standard biplane

   From an early age Charles Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the
   mechanics of motorized transportation including his family's [92]Saxon
   Six automobile, later his [93]Excelsior motorbike, and by the time he
   enrolled as a [94]mechanical engineering student at the [95]University
   of Wisconsin in 1920, he had also become fascinated with flying even
   though he "had never been close enough to a plane to touch it."^[96][9]
   Lindbergh dropped out of the engineering program in February 1922, and
   a month later headed to [97]Lincoln, Nebraska, to enroll as a student
   at the flying school operated by the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation.
   Arriving on April 1, 1922, he flew for the first time in his life nine
   days later when he took to the air as a passenger in a two-seat
   Lincoln-Standard "Tourabout" biplane piloted by [98]Otto Timm.^[99][10]

   A few days later Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that
   same machine with instructor-pilot Ira O. Biffle, although the 20-year
   old student pilot would never be permitted to "solo" during his time at
   the school because he could not afford to post a bond which the company
   President Ray Page,^[100][11] insisted upon in the event the novice
   flyer were to damage the school's only trainer in the
   process.^[101][12] Thus in order to both gain some needed experience
   and earn money for additional instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in
   June to spend the summer and early fall [102]barnstorming across
   Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a [103]wing walker
   and [104]parachutist with E.G. Bahl, and later H.L. Lynch. During this
   time he also briefly held a job as an airplane mechanic in
   [105]Billings, Montana, working at the Billings Municipal Airport
   (later renamed [106]Billings Logan International
   Airport).^[107][13]^[108][14] When winter came, however, Lindbergh
   returned to his father's home in Minnesota and did not fly again for
   over six months.^[109][15]
   Curtis JN-4 "Jenny"

   Lindbergh's first solo flight did not come until May 1923 at
   [110]Souther Field in [111]Americus, Georgia, a former Army flight
   training field to which he had come to buy a World War I surplus
   [112]Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" biplane. Even though Lindbergh had not had a
   lesson (or even flown) in more than half a year, he had nonetheless
   already secretly decided that he was ready to take to the air by
   himself. And so, after just half an hour of dual time with a pilot who
   was visiting the field to pick up another surplus JN-4, Lindbergh flew
   on his own for the first time in the Jenny that he had just purchased
   there for $500.^[113][16]^[114][17] After spending another week or so
   at the field to "practice" (thereby acquiring five hours of "pilot in
   command" time), Lindbergh took off from Americus for [115]Montgomery,
   Alabama, on his first solo cross country flight, and went on to spend
   much of the rest of 1923 engaged in virtually nonstop barnstorming
   under the name of "Daredevil Lindbergh". Unlike the previous year,
   however, this time Lindbergh did so in his "own ship"—and as a
   pilot.^[116][18]^[117][19] A few weeks after leaving Americus, the
   young airman achieved another key aviation milestone when he made his
   first nighttime flight near [118]Lake Village, Arkansas.^[119][20]

   Lindbergh damaged his "Jenny" on several occasions over the summer,
   usually by breaking the prop on landing (which happened on May 18, 1923
   outside Maben, Mississippi). His most serious accident came when he ran
   into a ditch in a farm field in [120]Glencoe, Minnesota, on June 3,
   1923, while flying his father (who was then running for the U.S.
   Senate) to a campaign stop. The accident grounded him for a week until
   he could repair his plane. In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to
   [121]Iowa where he sold it to a flying student of his. (Found stored in
   a barn in Iowa almost half a century later, Lindbergh's dismantled
   Jenny was carefully restored in the early 1970s and is now on display
   at the [122]Cradle of Aviation Museum located in [123]Garden City, New
   York, adjacent to the site once occupied by Roosevelt Field from which
   Lindbergh took off on his flight to Paris in 1927).^[124][21] After
   selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train where he
   joined up with Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South
   for the next few months in Klink's Curtis JN-4C "Canuck" (the Canadian
   version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also "cracked up" this aircraft once
   when his engine failed shortly after take off in [125]Pensacola,
   Florida, but again he managed to repair the damage himself.^[126][22]

   Following a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two
   pilots parted company in [127]San Antonio, [128]Texas, where Lindbergh
   had been ordered to report to [129]Brooks Field on March 19, 1924, to
   begin a year of military flight training with the [130]United States
   Army Air Service both there and later at nearby [131]Kelly
   Field.^[132][23] Late in his training Lindbergh experienced his worst
   flying accident on March 5, 1925 when, eight days before graduation, he
   was involved in a midair collision with another Army [133]S.E.5 while
   practicing aerial combat maneuvers and was forced to bail
   out.^[134][24] Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training
   remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March
   1925 thereby earning his Army pilot's wings and a commission as a
   [135]2nd Lieutenant in the [136]Air Service Reserve Corps.

   Lindbergh later noted in "WE", his best selling book published in July
   1927, just two months after making his historic flight to Paris, that
   he considered this year of Army flight training to be the critically
   important one in his development as both a focused, goal oriented
   individual, as well as a skillful and resourceful aviator.
   [137]WE CAL 1927.jpg

   "Always there was some new experience, always something interesting
   going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner
   years in a pilot's life. The training is difficult and rigid but there
   is none better. A cadet must be willing to forget all other interest in
   life when he enters the Texas flying schools and he must enter with the
   intention of devoting every effort and all of the energy during the
   next 12 months towards a single goal. But when he receives the wings at
   Kelly a year later he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has
   graduated from one of the world's finest flying schools." ^[138][25]
   "WE" (p. 125)

   With the Army not then in need of additional active duty pilots,
   however, following graduation Lindbergh immediately returned to
   civilian aviation as a barnstormer and [139]flight instructor, although
   as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part time military
   flying by joining the 110th Observation Squadron, 35th Division,
   Missouri [140]National Guard, in St. Louis in November 1925 and was
   soon promoted to [141]1st Lieutenant.^[142][26]

   February 6–12, 1927

   In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the Robertson Aircraft
   Corporation (RAC) in St. Louis (where he had been working as a flight
   instructor) to first lay out, and then serve as chief pilot for the
   newly designated 278-mile (447 km) [144]Contract Air Mail Route #2
   (CAM-2) to provide service between [145]St. Louis and [146]Chicago
   (Maywood Field) with two intermediate stops in [147]Springfield and
   [148]Peoria, Illinois.^[149][27] Operating from Robertson's home base
   at the [150]Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in Anglum, Missouri,
   Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots, Philip R. Love, Thomas P. Nelson,
   and Harlan A. "Bud" Gurney, flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four
   modified war surplus [151]de Havilland DH-4 [152]biplanes. Two days
   before he opened service on the route on April 15, 1926, with its first
   early morning southbound flight from Chicago to St. Louis, Lindbergh
   officially became authorized to be entrusted with the "care, custody,
   and conveyance" of U.S. Mails by formally subscribing and swearing to
   the Post Office Department's 1874 Oath of Mail Messengers.^[153][28] It
   would not take long for him to be presented with the circumstances to
   prove how seriously he took this obligation.

   1926

   Twice during the 10 months that he flew CAM-2, Lindbergh temporarily
   lost "custody and control" of mails that he was transporting when he
   was forced to bail out of his mail plane owing to bad weather,
   equipment problems, and/or fuel exhaustion. In the two incidents, which
   both occurred while he was approaching Chicago at night, Lindbergh
   landed by parachute near small farming communities in northeastern
   Illinois. On September 16, 1926, he came down about 60 miles (97 km)
   southwest of Chicago near the town of [154]Wedron,^[155][29] while six
   weeks later on November 3, 1926, Lindbergh bailed out again about
   70 miles (110 km) further south hitting the ground in another farm
   field located just west of the city of [156]Bloomington near the town
   of Covell.^[157][30] After landing without serious injury on both
   occasions, Lindbergh's first concern was to immediately locate the
   wreckage of his crashed mail planes, make sure that the bags of mail
   were promptly secured and salvaged, and then to see that they were
   entrained or trucked on to Chicago with as little further delay as
   possible. Lindbergh continued on as chief pilot of CAM-2 until
   mid-February 1927, when he left for [158]San Diego, [159]California, to
   oversee the design and construction of the Spirit of St.
   Louis.^[160][31]

   Although Lindbergh never returned to service as a regular U.S. Air Mail
   pilot, for many years after making his historic nonstop flight to Paris
   he used the immense fame that his exploits had brought him to help
   promote the use of the U.S. Air Mail Service. He did this by giving
   many speeches on its behalf, and by carrying souvenir mail on both
   special promotional domestic flights as well as on a number of
   international flights over routes in [161]Latin America and the
   [162]Caribbean which he had laid out as a consultant to [163]Pan
   American Airways to be then flown under contract to the Post Office
   Department as Foreign Air Mail (FAM) routes. At the request of Capt.
   Basil L. Rowe, the owner and Chief Pilot of West Indian Aerial Express
   and a fellow Air Mail pioneer and advocate, in February 1928, Lindbergh
   also carried a small amount of special souvenir mail between [164]Santo
   Domingo, [165]R.D., [166]Port-au-Prince, [167]Haiti, and [168]Havana,
   [169]Cuba in the Spirit of St. Louis.^[170][32]

   Lindbergh over CAM-2 on February 21, 1928, and southbound on February

   Those cities were the last three stops that he and the Spirit made
   during their 7,800-mile (12,600 km) "Good Will Tour" of Latin America
   and the Caribbean between December 13, 1927 and February 8, 1928,
   during which he flew to [171]Mexico, [172]Guatemala, [173]Belize,
   [174]El Salvador, [175]Honduras, [176]Nicaragua, [177]Costa Rica,
   [178]Panama, [179]Colombia, [180]Venezuela, [181]Virgin Islands,
   [182]Puerto Rico, [183]Dominican Republic, [184]Haiti, and [185]Cuba,
   spending 125 hours in the air.^[186][33] The final two legs of the
   48-day tour were also the only flights on which officially sanctioned,
   postally franked mail was ever carried in the Spirit of St. Louis.
   Exactly two weeks later, Lindbergh also "returned" to flying CAM-2 for
   two days so that he could pilot a series of special flights (northbound
   on February 20; southbound on February 21) on which many tens of
   thousands of self-addressed souvenir covers sent in from all over the
   nation and the world were [187]cacheted, flown, backstamped, and then
   returned to their senders as a further means to promote awareness and
   the use of the Air Mail Service. Souvenir covers and other artifacts
   associated with or carried on flights piloted by Lindbergh are still
   actively collected under the general designation of
   "Lindberghiana."^[188][34]

[[189]edit] Pursuing the Orteig Prize

   Charles Lindbergh (left) accepted his prize from Raymond Orteig (right)
   in New York on June 14, 1927

   Designated to be awarded to the pilot of the first successful nonstop
   flight made in either direction between [190]New York City and
   [191]Paris within five years after its establishment, the $25,000
   [192]Orteig Prize was first offered by the French-born New York
   hotelier (Lafayette Hotel) [193]Raymond Orteig on May 19, 1919.
   Although that initial time limit lapsed without a serious challenger,
   the state of aviation technology had advanced sufficiently by 1924 to
   prompt Orteig to extend his offer for another five years, and this time
   it began to attract an impressive grouping of well known, highly
   experienced, and well financed contenders. Ironically, the one
   exception among these competitors was the still boyish Charles
   Lindbergh, a 25-year-old relative latecomer to the race, who, in
   relation to the others, was virtually anonymous to the public as an
   aviation figure, who had considerably less overall flying experience,
   and was being primarily financed by just a $15,000 bank loan and his
   own modest savings.^[194][35]

   The first of the well-known challengers to actually attempt a flight
   was famed World War I French [195]flying ace [196]René Fonck who on
   September 21, 1926, planned to fly eastbound from [197]Roosevelt
   Airfield in New York in a three-engine [198]Sikorsky S-35. Fonck never
   got off the ground, however, as his grossly overloaded (by 10,000 lbs)
   transport biplane crashed and burned on takeoff when its landing gear
   collapsed. (While Fonck escaped the flames, his two crew members,
   Charles N. Clavier and Jacob Islaroff, died in the fire.) U.S. Naval
   aviators [199]LCDR Noel Davis and [200]LT Stanton H. Wooster were also
   killed in a takeoff accident at [201]Langley Field, [202]Virginia, on
   April 26, 1927, while testing the three-engine Keystone Pathfinder
   biplane, American Legion, that they intended to use for the flight.
   Less than two weeks later, the first contenders to actually get
   airborne were French war heroes Captain [203]Charles Nungesser and his
   navigator, [204]François Coli, who departed from [205]Paris - Le
   Bourget Airport on May 8, 1927, on a westbound flight in the
   [206]Levasseur PL 8, [207]The White Bird (L'Oiseau Blanc), although
   contact was lost with them after crossing the coast of [208]Ireland and
   they were never seen nor heard from again.^[209][36]

   American air racer [210]Clarence D. Chamberlin and [211]Arctic explorer
   [212]CDR (later [213]RADM) [214]Richard E. Byrd were also in the race.
   Although he did not win, Chamberlin and his passenger, [215]Charles A.
   Levine, made the far less well remembered second successful nonstop
   flight of a heavier-than-air aircraft across the [216]Atlantic Ocean
   between New York and Europe in the single engine Wright-Bellanca WB-2
   Miss Columbia (N-X-237), leaving Roosevelt Field on June 4, 1927, two
   weeks after Lindbergh's flight and landing in [217]Eisleben, Germany
   near [218]Berlin 43 hours and 31 minutes later on June 6, 1927.
   (Ironically, the Chamberlin monoplane was the same one that the
   Lindbergh group had originally intended to purchase for his attempt but
   passed on when the manufacturer insisted on selecting the pilot.) Byrd
   followed suit in the [219]Fokker F.VII tri-motor, [220]America, flying
   with three others from Roosevelt Field on June 29, 1927. Although they
   reached Paris on July 1, 1927, Byrd was unable to land there because of
   weather and was forced to return to the [221]Normandy coast where he
   ditched the tri-motor high wing monoplane near the French village of
   [222]Ver-sur-Mer.^[223][37]

[[224]edit] Lindbergh's flight to Paris

   Part of the funding for the Spirit of St. Louis came from Lindbergh's
   own earnings as a U.S. Air Mail pilot over the year before his nonstop
   flight to Paris. (January 15, 1927, RAC paycheck to Lindbergh)

   Six well known aviators had thus already lost their lives in pursuit of
   the Orteig Prize when Lindbergh took off on his successful attempt in
   the early morning of Friday, May 20, 1927. Dubbed the [225]Spirit of
   St. Louis, his "partner" was a fabric covered, single-seat,
   single-engine "Ryan NYP" high wing monoplane ([226]CAB registration:
   N-X-211) designed by Donald Hall and custom built by [227]Ryan
   Aeronautical Company of San Diego, California. The primary source of
   funding for the purchase of the Spirit and other expenses related to
   the overall New York to Paris effort came from a $15,000 State National
   Bank of St. Louis loan made on February 18, 1927, to St. Louis
   businessmen Harry H. Knight and Harold M. Bixby, the project's two
   principal [228]trustees,^[229][N 2] and another $1,000 donated by Frank
   Robertson of RAC on the same day. Lindbergh himself also personally
   contributed $2,000 of his own money from both his savings and his
   earnings from the 10 months that he flew the U.S. Air Mail for
   RAC.^[230][38]

   Burdened by its heavy load of 450 [231]U.S. gallons of gasoline
   (approximately 2,710 lbs) and hampered by a muddy, rain soaked runway,
   Lindbergh's [232]Wright Whirlwind powered monoplane gained speed very
   slowly as it made its 7:52 AM takeoff run from Roosevelt Field, but its
   J-5C radial engine still proved powerful enough to allow the Spirit to
   clear the telephone lines at the far end of the field "by about twenty
   feet with a fair reserve of flying speed."^[233][39] Over the next 33.5
   hours he and the "Spirit"—which Lindbergh always jointly referred to
   simply as "WE"—faced many challenges including skimming over both
   [234]storm clouds at 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and wave tops at as low at
   10 ft (3.0 m), fighting [235]icing, flying blind through [236]fog for
   several hours, and navigating only [237]by the stars (whenever visible)
   and [238]"dead reckoning" before landing at [239]Le Bourget Airport at
   10:22 PM on that Saturday, May 21.^[240][40] A crowd estimated at
   150,000 spectators stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the
   cockpit, and literally carried him around above their heads for "nearly
   half an hour." While some damage was done to the Spirit (especially to
   the fabric covering on the [241]fuselage) by souvenir hunters, both
   Lindbergh and the Spirit were eventually "rescued" from the mob by a
   group of French military fliers, soldiers, and police who took them
   both to safety in a nearby hangar.^[242][41] From that moment on,
   however, life would never again be the same for the previously little
   known former U.S. Air Mail pilot who, by his successful flight, had
   just achieved virtually instantaneous—and lifelong—world fame.
   Charles Lindbergh with the Spirit of St. Louis - 1927

   Although Lindbergh was the first to fly nonstop from New York to Paris,
   he was not the first aviator to complete a transatlantic flight in a
   [243]heavier-than-air aircraft. That had been done first in stages
   between May 8 and May 31, 1919, by the crew of the Navy-Curtiss
   [244]NC-4 flying boat which took 24 days to complete its journey from
   [245]Jamaica Bay at [246]Far Rockaway, [247]Queens, New York, to
   [248]Plymouth, [249]England, via [250]Halifax, Nova Scotia,
   [251]Trepassey Bay ([252]Newfoundland), [253]Horta (Azores) and
   [254]Lisbon, [255]Portugal. The [256]lighter-than-air (LTA) [257]U.S.
   Navy [258]airship [259]USS Los Angeles (ZR-3) made a non-stop crossing
   from the Zeppelin Company works in [260]Friedrichshafen, [261]Germany
   to the U.S. Naval Air Station at [262]Lakehurst, New Jersey from
   October 12 to 15, 1924.^[263][42]

   The world's first non-stop [264]transatlantic flight (albeit over a
   route far shorter than Lindbergh's, 1,890 miles (3,040 km) vs.
   3,600 statute miles (5,800 km)) was achieved nearly eight years earlier
   on June 14–15, 1919. Two British aviators, [265]John Alcock and Arthur
   Whitten Brown, flew a modified [266]Vickers Vimy IV bomber from
   Lester's Field near [267]St. John's, Newfoundland on June 14 and
   arrived at [268]Clifden, Ireland, the following day.^[269][43] Both men
   were knighted at [270]Buckingham Palace by [271]King [272]George V, in
   recognition of their pioneering achievement.^[273][44]

   The Spirit's flight from Paris to Belgium

   The French Foreign Office flew the American flag, the first time it had
   saluted someone not a head of state.^[276][45] Lindbergh made a series
   of flights in Europe using the Spirit before returning to the United
   States. [277]Gaston Doumergue, the [278]President of France, bestowed
   the French [279]Légion d'honneur on the young Capt. Lindbergh, and on
   his arrival back in the United States aboard the United States Navy
   [280]cruiser [281]USS Memphis (CL-13) on June 11, 1927, a fleet of
   warships and multiple flights of military aircraft including pursuit
   planes, bombers and the rigid airship [282]USS Los Angeles (ZR-3),
   escorted him up the [283]Potomac River to [284]Washington, D.C. where
   President [285]Calvin Coolidge awarded him the [286]Distinguished
   Flying Cross.^[287][46]^[288][47]
   "Lindbergh [289]Air Mail" Stamp (C-10) issued June 11, 1927

   On that same day that Lindbergh and the Spirit arrived in Washington,
   the [290]U.S. Post Office Department issued a 10-Cent [291]Air Mail
   stamp (Scott C-10) depicting the Spirit of St. Louis and a map of the
   flight. On June 13, 1927, a [292]ticker-tape parade was held for him
   down 5th Avenue in New York City.^[293][48] The following night the
   City of New York further honored Capt. Lindbergh with a grand banquet
   at the Hotel Commodore attended by some 3,700 people.^[294][49]
   Program cover for the "WE" Banquet given by the Mayor's Committee on
   Receptions of the City of New York on June 14, 1927

   After the flight, Lindbergh became an important voice on behalf of
   aviation activities, including the central committee of the
   [295]National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in the United States.
   He embarked on a three-month cross country tour on behalf of the
   [296]Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. The 1927
   "Lindbergh Tour" culminated with visits to 48 states and 92 cities,
   where he delivered 147 speeches, and rode 1,290 miles (2,080 km) in
   parades.^[297][26] At the conclusion of the tour, Lindbergh spent a
   month at Falaise, Guggenheim's Sands Point mansion, where he wrote the
   acclaimed "We", a book about his transatlantic flight published by
   [298]George P. Putnam.

   The massive publicity surrounding him and his flight boosted the
   aviation industry and made a skeptical public take air travel
   seriously. Within a year of his flight, a quarter of Americans (an
   estimated thirty million) personally saw Lindbergh and the Spirit of
   St. Louis. Over the remainder of 1927 applications for pilot's licenses
   in the U.S. trebled, the number of licensed aircraft quadrupled, and
   U.S. Airline passengers grew between 1926 and 1929 by 3,000% from 5,782
   to 173,405.^[299][50] Lindbergh later charted both polar and South
   American air routes, developed techniques for high altitude flying, and
   during WWII demonstrated how to increase flying range by decreasing
   fuel consumption.

   The winner of the 1930 Best Woman Aviator of the Year Award, Elinor
   Smith Sullivan, said that before Lindbergh's flight, "people seemed to
   think we [aviators] were from outer space or something. But after
   Charles Lindbergh's flight, we could do no wrong. It's hard to describe
   the impact Lindbergh had on people. Even the first walk on the moon
   doesn't come close. The twenties was such an innocent time, and people
   were still so religious—I think they felt like this man was sent by God
   to do this. And it changed aviation forever because all of a sudden the
   [300]Wall Streeters were banging on doors looking for airplanes to
   invest in. We'd been standing on our heads trying to get them to notice
   us but after Lindbergh, suddenly everyone wanted to fly, and there
   weren't enough planes to carry them."^[301][51]

[[302]edit] Marriage and children

   Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh

   [303]Anne Morrow Lindbergh (1906–2001) was the daughter of diplomat
   [304]Dwight Morrow whom he met in Mexico City in December 1927, where
   her father was serving as the U.S. Ambassador. According to a
   [305]Biography Channel profile on Lindbergh, she was the only woman
   that he had ever asked out on a date. In Lindbergh's autobiography, he
   derides womanizing pilots he met as "barnstormers", and Army cadets for
   their "facile" approach to relationships. For Lindbergh, the ideal
   romance was stable and long term, with a woman with keen intellect,
   good health and strong genes.^[306][52] Lindbergh said his "experience
   in breeding animals on our farm had taught me the importance of good
   heredity."^[307][53]

   The couple was married on May 27, 1929, and eventually had six
   children: [308]Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr. (1930–1932); Jon Morrow
   Lindbergh (b. August 16, 1932); Land Morrow Lindbergh (b. 1937), who
   studied anthropology at [309]Stanford University and married Susan
   Miller in San Diego; [310]Anne Lindbergh (1940–1993); Scott Lindbergh
   (b. 1942); and Reeve Lindbergh (b. 1945), a writer. Lindbergh also
   taught his wife how to fly and did much of his exploring and charting
   of air routes with her.

[[311]edit] "The Crime of the Century"

   Main article: [312]Lindbergh kidnapping
   The "wanted" poster

   In what came to be referred to sensationally by the press of the time
   as "The Crime of the Century", on the evening of March 1, 1932,
   20-month old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., was abducted by an
   intruder from his crib in the second story nursery of his family's
   rural home in [313]East Amwell, New Jersey near the town of
   [314]Hopewell.^[315][N 3] While a 10-week nationwide search for the
   child was being undertaken, [316]ransom negotiations were also
   conducted simultaneously with a self-identified kidnapper by a
   volunteer intermediary, Dr. John F. Condon (aka "Jafsie").^[317][55]
   These resulted in the payment on April 2 of $50,000 in cash, part of
   which was made in soon-to-be withdrawn (and thus more easily traceable)
   [318]Gold certificates, in exchange for information—which proved to be
   false—about the child's whereabouts. The search finally ended on May 12
   when the remains of an infant were serendipitously discovered by truck
   driver William Allen about two miles (3 km) from the Lindberghs' home
   in the woods near a road just north of the small village of Mount Rose,
   NJ. The child's body was soon identified by Lindbergh as being that of
   his kidnapped son. A month later the Congress passed the so-called
   [319]"Lindbergh Law" ([320]18 U.S.C. [321]§ 1201(a)(1)) on June 13,
   1932, which made kidnapping a [322]federal offense if the victim is
   taken across state lines or "uses the mail or any means, facility, or
   instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in committing or in
   furtherance of the commission of the offense" including as a means to
   demand a ransom.^[323][56]
   Lindbergh testifies at the Hauptmann trial in 1935

   Assiduous tracing of many $10 and $20 Gold certificates passed in the
   New York City area over the next year-and-a-half eventually led police
   to [324]Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a 34-year old German immigrant
   carpenter, who was arrested near his home in [325]The Bronx, New York,
   on September 19, 1934. A stash containing $13,760 of the ransom money
   was subsequently found hidden in his garage. Charged with kidnapping,
   extortion, and first degree murder, Hauptmann went on trial in a
   [326]circus-like atmosphere in [327]Flemington, New Jersey on January
   2, 1935. Six weeks later he was convicted on all counts when, following
   just eleven hours of deliberation, the jury delivered its verdict late
   on the night of February 13 after which trial judge Thomas Trenchard
   immediately sentenced Hauptmann to death.^[328][57] Although he
   continued to adamantly maintain his innocence, all of Hauptmann's
   appeals and petitions for clemency were rejected by early December
   1935.^[329][58] Despite a last minute attempt by [330]New Jersey
   Governor [331]Harold G. Hoffman (who believed Hauptmann was guilty but
   also had always expressed doubts that he could have acted alone) to
   convince him to confess to the crimes in exchange for getting his
   sentence commuted to life imprisonment, the by then 36-year old
   Hauptmann refused and was electrocuted at [332]Trenton State Prison on
   April 3, 1936.^[333][59]

   The Lindberghs eventually grew tired of the never-ending spotlight on
   the family and came to fear for the safety of their then three-year old
   second son, Jon. Deciding, therefore, to seek seclusion in Europe, the
   family sailed from New York under a veil of secrecy on board the SS
   American Importer in the pre-dawn hours of December 22, 1935.^[334][60]
   The family rented "[335]Long Barn" in the village of [336]Sevenoaks
   Weald, [337]Kent, [338]England. One newspaper wrote that Lindbergh "won
   immediate popularity by announcing he intended to purchase his supplies
   'right in the village, from local tradesmen.' The reserve of the
   villagers, most of whom had decided in advance he would be a
   blustering, boastful young American, is melting."^[339][61] At the time
   of Hauptmann's execution, local police almost sealed off the area
   surrounding Long Barn with "orders to regard as suspects anyone except
   residents who approached within a mile of the home." Lindbergh later
   described his three years in the Kent village as "among the happiest
   days of my life."^[340][61] In 1938 the family moved to [341]Île
   Illiec, a small (four-acre) island Lindbergh purchased off the
   [342]Breton coast of [343]France.^[344][62]

[[345]edit] Pre-war activities

   Lindbergh became interested in the work of rocket pioneer [346]Robert
   H. Goddard in 1929. By helping Goddard secure an [347]endowment from
   [348]Daniel Guggenheim in 1930, Lindbergh allowed Goddard to expand his
   research and development. Throughout his life, Lindbergh remained a key
   advocate of Goddard's work.^[349][63]
   A Lindbergh perfusion pump, c. 1935

   In 1930, Lindbergh's sister-in-law developed a fatal heart condition.
   Lindbergh began to wonder why hearts could not be repaired with
   surgery. Starting in early 1931 at the Rockeffer Institute and
   continuing during his time living in France, Lindbergh studied the
   perfusion of organs outside the body with [350]Nobel Prize-winning
   French surgeon Dr. [351]Alexis Carrel. Although perfused organs were
   said to have survived surprisingly well, all showed progressive
   [352]degenerative changes within a few days.^[353][64] Lindbergh's
   invention, a glass [354]perfusion pump, named the "Model T" pump, is
   credited with making future [355]heart surgeries possible. However, in
   this early stage, the pump was far from perfected. In 1938, Lindbergh
   and Carrel summarized their work in their book, The Culture of Organs
   describing an [356]artificial heart^[357][65] but it was decades before
   one was built. In later years, Lindbergh's pump was further developed
   by others, eventually leading to the construction of the first
   heart-lung machine.^[358][66]
   Hermann Göring presents Lindbergh with a medal on behalf of Adolf
   Hitler; Anne Lindbergh is far left. Photo taken on July 28, 1936.

   At the behest of the [359]U.S. military, Lindbergh traveled several
   times to Germany to report on German aviation and the German Air Force
   ([360]Luftwaffe) from 1936 through 1938.^[[361]citation needed]

   Lindbergh toured German aviation facilities, where the commander of the
   Luftwaffe [362]Hermann Göring convinced Lindbergh the Luftwaffe was far
   more powerful than it was. With the approval of Göring and [363]Ernst
   Udet, Lindbergh was the first American permitted to examine the
   Luftwaffe's newest bomber, the [364]Junkers Ju 88 and Germany's front
   line [365]fighter aircraft, the [366]Messerschmitt Bf 109. Lindbergh
   received the unprecedented opportunity to pilot the Bf 109. Lindbergh
   said of the fighter that he knew "of no other pursuit plane which
   combines simplicity of construction with such excellent performance
   characteristics." Colonel Lindbergh inspected all the types of military
   aircraft Germany was to use in 1939 and 1940.^[[367]citation needed]
   Lindbergh's medal (Service Cross of the German Eagle)

   Lindbergh reported to the U.S. military that Germany was leading in
   metal construction, low-wing designs, [368]dirigibles and [369]diesel
   engines. Lindbergh also undertook a survey of aviation in the
   [370]Soviet Union in 1938. Lindbergh's findings found their way into
   air intelligence reports to Washington long before the European war
   began."^[371][67]

   The American ambassador to Germany, Hugh Wilson, invited Lindbergh to
   dinner with Göring at the American embassy in Berlin in 1938. The
   dinner included diplomats and three of the greatest minds of German
   aviation, [372]Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumaker and Dr. [373]Willy
   Messerschmitt. For Lindbergh's 1927 flight and services to aviation, on
   behalf of Adolf Hitler, Göring presented him with the Commander Cross
   of the [374]Order of the German Eagle. ([375]Henry Ford received the
   same award earlier in July.) However, Lindbergh's acceptance of the
   medal caused controversy after [376]Kristallnacht. Lindbergh declined
   to return the medal, later writing (according to [377]A. Scott Berg):
   "It seems to me that the returning of decorations, which were given in
   times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive
   effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems to me that it
   would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can
   see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war
   begins."^[[378]citation needed]

   During this period, Lindbergh was back on temporary duty as a colonel
   in the Army Air Corps assigned to the task of recruitment, finding a
   site for a new air force research institute and other potential air
   bases.^[379][68] Another role that he undertook was in evaluating new
   aircraft types in development. Assigned a [380]Curtiss P-36 fighter, he
   toured various facilities, reporting back to Wright Field.^[381][68]

[[382]edit] Munich Crisis

   At the urging of U.S. Ambassador [383]Joseph Kennedy, Lindbergh wrote a
   secret memo to the British warning that if Britain and France responded
   militarily to German dictator [384]Adolf Hitler's violation of the
   [385]Munich Agreement in 1938, it would be suicide. Lindbergh stated
   that France's military strength was inadequate and that Britain had an
   outdated military over-reliant upon naval power. He recommended they
   urgently strengthen their air arsenal in order to force Hitler to turn
   his ambitions eastward to a war against "Asiatic Communism."^[386][69]

   In a controversial 1939 [387]Reader's Digest article, Lindbergh said,
   "Our civilization depends on peace among Western nations... and
   therefore on united strength, for Peace is a virgin who dare not show
   her face without Strength, her father, for
   protection."^[388][70]^[389][71] Lindbergh deplored the rivalry between
   Germany and Britain but favored a war between Germany and Russia. There
   is some controversy as to how accurate his reports concerning the
   Luftwaffe were, but Cole reports the consensus among British and
   American officials was that they were slightly exaggerated but badly
   needed.^[[390]citation needed]

[[391]edit] "America First" Involvement

   [392]Am1logo.jpg

   In late 1940, he became spokesman of the antiwar [393]America First
   Committee.^[394][72] He soon became its most prominent public
   spokesman, speaking to overflowing crowds in [395]Madison Square Garden
   in New York City and [396]Soldier Field in Chicago. His speeches were
   heard by millions. During this time, Lindbergh lived in [397]Lloyd
   Neck, on [398]Long Island, New York.

   Lindbergh argued that America did not have any business attacking
   Germany and believed in upholding the [399]Monroe Doctrine, which his
   [400]interventionist rivals felt was outdated. Before World War II,
   according to Lindbergh historian A. Scott Berg, Lindbergh characterized
   that:

     “the potentially gigantic power of America, guided by uninformed and
     impractical idealism, might crusade into Europe to destroy Hitler
     without realizing that Hitler’s destruction would lay Europe open to
     the rape, loot and barbarism of Soviet Russia’s forces, causing
     possibly the fatal wounding of western civilization.”^[401][73]

   Charles Lindbergh speaking at an AFC rally

   In his January 23, 1941, testimony in opposition to the [402]Lend-Lease
   Bill before the [403]House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Lindbergh
   proposed that the United States negotiate a neutrality pact with
   Germany.^[404][74] President Roosevelt publicly criticized Lindbergh's
   views on neutrality three months later during a White House press
   conference on April 25, 1941, as being those of a "defeatist and
   appeaser" and compared him to [405]U.S. Rep. Clement L. Vallandigham
   (D-OH), the leader of the [406]"Copperhead" movement that had opposed
   the [407]American Civil War. Three days later the famed aviator
   resigned his commission as a Colonel in the [408]U.S. Army Air Corps in
   an April 28 letter to the President in which Lindbergh said that he
   could find "no honorable alternative" to his taking such an action
   after Roosevelt had publicly questioned his loyalty.^[409][75]

   In a speech at an America First rally in [410]Des Moines on September
   11, 1941, "Who Are the War Agitators?" Lindbergh claimed the three
   groups, "pressing this country toward war [are] the British, the Jewish
   and the Roosevelt Administration" and said of Jewish groups,

     "Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country
     should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among
     the first to feel its consequences. Tolerance is a virtue that
     depends upon peace and strength. History shows that it cannot
     survive war and devastation."^[411][76]

   In the speech, he warned of the Jewish People's "large ownership and
   influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our
   government", and went on to say of Germany's antisemitism, "No person
   with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of
   the Jewish race in Germany." Lindbergh declared,

     "I am not attacking either the Jewish or the British people. Both
     races, I admire. But I am saying that the leaders of both the
     British and the Jewish races, for reasons which are as
     understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from
     ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the
     war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to
     be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We
     cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to
     lead our country to destruction."^[412][77]

   The speech was heavily criticized as being anti-Jewish.^[413][78] In
   response Lindbergh noted again he was not anti-Semitic, but he did not
   back away from his statements.

   [414]Interventionists created pamphlets pointing out his efforts were
   praised in [415]Nazi Germany and included quotations such as "Racial
   strength is vital; politics, a luxury". They included pictures of him
   and other America Firsters using the stiff-armed [416]Bellamy salute (a
   hand gesture described by [417]Francis Bellamy to accompany his
   [418]Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States); the photos
   were taken from an angle not showing the American flag, so to observers
   it was indistinguishable from the [419]Hitler salute.^[420][79]

   [421]President [422]Franklin D. Roosevelt disliked Lindbergh's
   outspoken opposition to intervention and Roosevelt's policies such as
   the [423]Lend-Lease Act. Roosevelt said to Treasury Secretary
   [424]Henry Morgenthau in May 1940, "if I should die tomorrow, I want
   you to know this, I am absolutely convinced Lindbergh is a
   Nazi."^[425][80] To satisfy FDR's political interest in discrediting
   his prominent foreign policy critics, FBI Director Hoover, on his own
   authority, began to investigate Lindbergh's personal life. Hoover had
   his FBI agents look for anything that might discredit Lindbergh's
   reputation as a decent, moral man, such as information purporting that
   during Prohibition, Lindbergh had [426]bootlegged whiskey in
   [427]Montana and had consorted with pimps and prostitutes. While not
   ordering the FBI to look into Lindbergh, given his prejudices against
   the famous aviator, President Roosevelt all the same did not complain
   about the FBI director's efforts.^[428][81]

[[429]edit] Thoughts on race and racism

   Lindbergh elucidated his beliefs about the [430]white race in an
   article he published in Reader's Digest in 1939:

   "We can have peace and security only so long as we band together to
   preserve that most priceless possession, our inheritance of European
   blood, only so long as we guard ourselves against attack by foreign
   armies and dilution by foreign races."^[431][82]

   Because of his trips to Nazi Germany, combined with a belief in
   [432]eugenics, Lindbergh was suspected of being a Nazi sympathizer.

   Lindbergh's reaction to [433]Kristallnacht was entrusted to his diary:
   "I do not understand these riots on the part of the Germans," he wrote.
   "It seems so contrary to their sense of order and intelligence. They
   have undoubtedly had a difficult '[434]Jewish problem,' but why is it
   necessary to handle it so unreasonably?"^[435][83]

   In his diaries, he wrote: “We must limit to a reasonable amount the
   Jewish influence...Whenever the Jewish percentage of total population
   becomes too high, a reaction seems to invariably occur. It is too bad
   because a few Jews of the right type are, I believe, an asset to any
   country.”

   Lindbergh's [436]anti-communism resonated deeply with many Americans
   while [437]eugenics and [438]Nordicism enjoyed social
   acceptance.^[439][71]

   Although Lindbergh considered Hitler a fanatic and avowed a belief in
   American democracy,^[440][84] he clearly stated elsewhere that he
   believed the survival of the white race was more important than the
   survival of democracy in Europe: "Our bond with Europe is one of race
   and not of political ideology," he declared.^[441][85] He had, however,
   a relatively positive attitude toward blacks (something that was
   scheduled to be fully revealed in an undelivered speech interrupted by
   the events that followed the [442]attack on Pearl Harbor^[443][86]).
   Critics have noticed an apparent influence of German philosopher
   [444]Oswald Spengler on Lindbergh.^[445][87] Spengler was a
   conservative [446]authoritarian and during the [447]interwar era, was
   widely read throughout [448]Western World, though by this point he had
   fallen out of favor with the Nazis because he had not wholly subscribed
   to their theories of racial purity.^[[449]citation needed]

   hangar. Photo: August 1927.

   Lindbergh developed a long-term friendship with the automobile pioneer
   [451]Henry Ford, who was well-known for his [452]anti-Semitic newspaper
   [453]The Dearborn Independent. In a famous comment about Lindbergh to
   Detroit's former FBI field office special agent in charge in July 1940,
   Ford said: "When Charles comes out here, we only talk about the
   Jews."^[454][88]^[455][89]

   Lindbergh considered Russia to be a "semi-Asiatic" country compared to
   Germany, and he found [456]Communism to be an ideology that would
   destroy the West's "racial strength" and replace everyone of European
   descent with "a pressing sea of Yellow, Black, and Brown." He openly
   stated that if he had to choose, he would rather see America allied
   with Nazi Germany than Soviet Russia. He preferred [457]Nordics, but he
   believed, after Soviet Communism was defeated, Russia would be a
   valuable ally against potential aggression from [458]East
   Asia.^[459][87]^[460][90]

   Lindbergh said certain races have "demonstrated superior ability in the
   design, manufacture, and operation of machines."^[461][91] He further
   said, "The growth of our western civilization has been closely related
   to this superiority."^[462][92] Lindbergh admired "the German genius
   for science and organization, the English genius for government and
   commerce, the French genius for living and the understanding of life."
   He believed that "in America they can be blended to form the greatest
   genius of all."^[[463]citation needed] His message was popular
   throughout many Northern communities and especially well-received in
   the [464]Midwest, while the [465]American South was [466]Anglophilic
   and supported a pro-British foreign policy.^[467][93]

   Holocaust researcher and investigative journalist [468]Max Wallace
   agrees with Franklin Roosevelt's assessment that Lindbergh was
   "pro-Nazi" in his book, [469]The American Axis. However, Wallace finds
   the Roosevelt Administration's accusations of dual loyalty or
   [470]treason as unsubstantiated. Wallace considers Lindbergh a
   well-intentioned but bigoted and misguided Nazi sympathizer whose
   career as the leader of the isolationist movement had a destructive
   impact on Jewish people.^[[471]citation needed]

   Lindbergh's [472]Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, [473]A. Scott Berg,
   contends Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as
   someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in
   political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as
   one. Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without
   objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe.
   Indeed, the award did not cause controversy until the war began and
   Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message
   of non-intervention. Berg contends Lindbergh's views were commonplace
   in the United States in the pre-World War II era. Lindbergh's support
   for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of
   a number of American people.^[[474]citation needed]

   Yet Berg also notes that "As late as April 1939—after Germany overtook
   [475]Czechoslovakia—Lindbergh was willing to make excuses for Hitler.
   "Much as I disapprove of many things Hitler had done," he wrote in his
   diary on April 2, 1939, "I believe she [Germany] has pursued the only
   consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her
   broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other
   nations...in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one
   thing by law and another thing by history." Berg also explains that
   leading up to the war, in Lindbergh's mind, the great battle would be
   between the Soviet Union and Germany, not [476]fascism and democracy.
   In this war, he believed that a German victory was preferable because
   of Stalin's horrific acts, which, at the time, he believed were far
   worse than Hitler's.^[[477]citation needed]

   Berg finds Lindbergh believed in a voluntary rather than compulsory
   eugenics program.^[[478]citation needed] In [479]Pat Buchanan's book
   entitled A Republic, Not An Empire: Reclaiming America's Destiny, he
   portrays Lindbergh and other pre-war isolationists as American patriots
   who were smeared by interventionists during the months leading up to
   Pearl Harbor. Buchanan suggests the backlash against Lindbergh
   highlights "the explosiveness of mixing ethnic politics with foreign
   policy."^[480][94]

   Lindbergh always preached military strength and
   alertness.^[481][95]^[482][96] He believed that a strong defensive war
   machine would make America an impenetrable fortress and defend the
   [483]Western Hemisphere from an attack by foreign powers, and that this
   was the U.S. military's sole purpose.^[484][97]

   Many people^[[485]who?] acknowledge that Lindbergh helped keep American
   public opinion isolationist until 1941 by advancing the movement to
   keep America out of the war for as long as possible. Berg reveals that
   while the attack on Pearl Harbor came as a shock to Lindbergh, he did
   predict that America's "wavering policy in the [486]Philippines" would
   invite a bloody war there, and, in one speech, he warned that "we
   should either fortify these islands adequately, or get out of them
   entirely."^[[487]citation needed]

[[488]edit] World War II

   VMF-222 "Flying Deuces"

   After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lindbergh sought to be
   recommissioned in the United States Army Air Corps. The Secretary of
   War, [489]Henry L. Stimson, declined the request on instructions from
   the White House.^[490][98]

   Unable to take on an active military role, Lindbergh approached a
   number of aviation companies, offering his services as a consultant. As
   a technical adviser with Ford in 1942, he was heavily involved in
   troubleshooting early problems encountered at the [491]Willow Run
   [492]B-24 Liberator bomber production line. As B-24 production smoothed
   out, he joined United Aircraft in 1943 as an engineering consultant,
   devoting most of his time to its Chance-Vought Division. The following
   year, he persuaded United Aircraft to designate him a technical
   representative in the [493]Pacific War to study aircraft performances
   under combat conditions. He showed Marine [494]F4U Corsair pilots how
   to take off with twice the bomb load that the fighter-bomber was rated
   for and on May 21, 1944, he flew his first combat mission: a strafing
   run with [495]VMF-222 near the Japanese garrison of [496]Rabaul, in the
   [497]Australian [498]Territory of New Guinea.^[499][99] He was also
   flying with [500]VMF 216 (first squadron there) during this period from
   the Marine Air Base at Torokina, Bougainville British Solomon Islands.
   Several Marine squadrons were flying bomber escorts to destroy this
   Japanese stronghold. His first flight was escorted by Lt. Robert E.
   (Lefty) McDonough. It was understood that Lefty refused to fly with him
   again, as he did not want to be known as "the guy who killed
   Lindbergh." Lindbergh was willing to engage the enemy, which the Marine
   pilots were told to avoid.^[[501]citation needed]
   433rd Fighter Squadron "Satan's Angels"

   In his six months in the Pacific in 1944, Lindbergh took part in
   fighter bomber raids on Japanese positions, flying about 50 combat
   missions (again as a civilian). His innovations in the use of [502]P-38
   Lightning fighters impressed a supportive Gen. [503]Douglas
   MacArthur.^[504][100] Lindbergh introduced engine-leaning techniques to
   P-38 pilots, greatly improving fuel usage at cruise speeds, enabling
   the long-range fighter aircraft to fly longer range missions. The U.S.
   Marine and Army Air Force pilots who served with Lindbergh praised his
   courage and defended his patriotism.^[505][99]

   On July 28, 1944, during a P-38 bomber escort mission with the 433rd
   Fighter Squadron, 475th Fighter Group, Fifth Air Force, in the Ceram
   area, Lindbergh shot down a [506]Sonia observation plane piloted by
   Captain Saburo Shimada, Commanding Officer of the 73rd Independent
   Chutai.^[507][99]^[508][101]

   After the war, while touring the Nazi [509]concentration camps,
   Lindbergh wrote in his autobiography that he was disgusted and angered.
   ^[510][N 4]

[[511]edit] Later life

   After World War II, he lived in [512]Darien, Connecticut and served as
   a consultant to the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force and to Pan
   American World Airways. With most of Eastern Europe having fallen under
   Communist control, Lindbergh believed most of his pre-war assessments
   were correct all along. But Berg reports after witnessing the defeat of
   Germany and the [513]Holocaust firsthand shortly after his service in
   the Pacific, "he knew the American public no longer gave a hoot about
   his opinions." His 1953 book [514]The Spirit of St. Louis, recounting
   his nonstop transatlantic flight, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1954, and
   his literary agent, [515]George T. Bye, sold the film rights to
   Hollywood for more than a million dollars. [516]Dwight D. Eisenhower
   restored Lindbergh's assignment with the U.S. Army Air Corps and made
   him a [517]Brigadier General in 1954. In that year, he served on the
   Congressional advisory panel set up to establish the site of the
   [518]United States Air Force Academy. In December 1968, he visited the
   crew of [519]Apollo 8 on the eve of the first manned spaceflight to
   leave Earth orbit. On July 16, 1969, Lindbergh and the "Spirit of St.
   Louis" constructor, [520]Tubal Claude Ryan were present at [521]Cape
   Canaveral to watch the launch of [522]Apollo 11.^[523][103]

[[524]edit] Children from other relationships

   From 1957 until his death in 1974, Lindbergh had an affair with German
   hat maker Brigitte Hesshaimer (1926–2003) who lived in a small
   [525]Bavarian town called [526]Geretsried (35 km south of [527]Munich).
   On November 23, 2003, [528]DNA tests proved that he fathered her three
   children: Dyrk (1958), Astrid (1960) and David (1967). The two managed
   to keep the affair secret; even the children did not know the true
   identity of their father, whom they saw when he came to visit once or
   twice per year using the alias "Careu Kent." Astrid later read a
   magazine article about Lindbergh and found snapshots and more than a
   hundred letters written from him to her mother. She disclosed the
   affair after both Brigitte and Anne Morrow Lindbergh had died. At the
   same time as Lindbergh was involved with Brigitte Hesshaimer, he also
   had a relationship with her sister, Marietta (born 1924), who bore him
   two more sons: Vago (1960) and Christoph (1966). Lindbergh had a house
   of his own design built for Marietta in a vineyard in Grimisuat in the
   Swiss canton Valais.^[529][104]

   A 2005 book by German author Rudolf Schroeck, Das Doppelleben des
   Charles A. Lindbergh (The Double Life of Charles A. Lindbergh), claims
   seven secret children existed in Germany. It says Lindbergh "came and
   went as he pleased" during the last 17 years of his life, spending
   between three to five days with his Munich family about four to five
   times each year. "Ten days before he died in August 1974, Lindbergh
   wrote three letters from his hospital bed to his three mistresses and
   requested 'utmost secrecy'", Schroeck writes, whose book includes a
   copy of that letter to Brigitte Hesshaimer.^[[530]citation needed]

   Two of the seven children were from his relationship with the East
   Prussian aristocrat Valeska, who was Lindbergh's private secretary in
   Europe. They had a son in 1959 and a daughter in 1961. She had been
   friends with the Hesshaimer sisters and was the one who introduced them
   to Charles Lindbergh. In the beginning, they lived all together in his
   apartment in [531]Rome. However, the friendship ended when Brigitte
   Hesshaimer became pregnant by him as well. Valeska lives in
   [532]Baden-Baden and wants to keep her privacy, as mentioned in many
   German and International Reuter's newspaper articles, in Rudolf
   Schroek's book and a TV documentary by Danuta Harrich-Zandberg and
   Walter Harrich.^[[533]citation needed]

   In April 2008, Reeve Lindbergh, his youngest daughter with wife Anne
   Morrow Lindbergh, published Forward From Here: Leaving Middle Age and
   Other Unexpected Adventures, a book of essays that includes her
   discovery in 2003, of the truth about her father's three secret
   European families and her journeys to meet them and understand an
   expanded meaning of family.^[534][105]

[[535]edit] Environmental causes

   From the 1960s on, Lindbergh campaigned to protect [536]endangered
   species like [537]humpback and [538]blue whales, was instrumental in
   establishing protections for the controversial^[539][106] Filipino
   group, the [540]Tasaday, and African tribes, and supporting the
   establishment of a national park. While studying the native flora and
   fauna of the Philippines, he became involved in an effort to protect
   the [541]Philippine Eagle. In his final years, Lindbergh stressed the
   need to regain the balance between the world and the natural
   environment, and spoke against the introduction of supersonic
   airliners.^[[542]citation needed]

   Lindbergh's speeches and writings later in life emphasized his love of
   both technology and nature, and a lifelong belief that "all the
   achievements of mankind have value only to the extent that they
   preserve and improve the quality of life." In a 1967 Life magazine
   article, he said, "The human future depends on our ability to combine
   the knowledge of science with the wisdom of wildness."^[[543]citation
   needed]

   In honor of Charles and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh's vision of
   achieving balance between the technological advancements they helped
   pioneer, and the preservation of the human and natural environments,
   the Lindbergh Award was established in 1978. Each year since 1978, the
   Lindbergh Foundation has given the award to recipients whose work has
   made a significant contribution toward the concept of
   "balance."^[[544]citation needed]

   Lindbergh's final book, Autobiography of Values, based on an unfinished
   manuscript was published posthumously. While on his death bed, he had
   contacted his friend, William Jovanovich, head of Harcourt Brace
   Jovanovich, to edit the lengthy memoirs.^[545][107]

[[546]edit] Death

   Charles Lindbergh's grave

   Lindbergh spent his final years on the [547]Hawaiian island of
   [548]Maui, where he died of [549]lymphoma^[550][108] on August 26, 1974
   at age 72. He was buried on the grounds of the Palapala Ho'omau Church
   in [551]Kipahulu, [552]Maui. His [553]epitaph on a simple stone which
   quotes [554]Psalms 139:9, reads: "Charles A. Lindbergh Born Michigan
   1902 Died Maui 1974". The inscription further reads: "...If I take the
   wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea...
   C.A.L."^[[555]citation needed]

[[556]edit] Honors and tributes

   The Spirit of St. Louis on display at the [557]National Air and Space
   Museum in Washington, D.C.

   The Lindbergh Terminal at [558]Minneapolis-Saint Paul International
   Airport was named after him, and a replica of The Spirit of St. Louis
   hangs there. Another such replica hangs in the great hall at the
   recently rebuilt Jefferson Memorial at Forest Park in St. Louis. The
   definitive oil painting of Charles Lindbergh by St. Louisan Richard
   Krause entitled "The Spirit Soars" has been displayed there.^[559][109]
   San Diego's Lindbergh Field, which is also known as [560]San Diego
   International Airport, was named after him and also displays a replica
   of the San Diego-built Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis. The airport in
   [561]Winslow, Arizona has also been renamed Winslow-Lindbergh Regional.
   Lindbergh himself designed the airport in 1929 when it was built as a
   refueling point for the first coast-to-coast air service. Among the
   many airports and air facilities that bear his name, the airport in
   Little Falls, Minnesota, where he grew up, has been named Little
   Falls/Morrison County-Lindbergh Field.^[[562]citation needed]

   The original The Spirit of St. Louis currently resides in the National
   Air and Space Museum as part of the collection of the Smithsonian
   Institution.

   In 1952, Grandview High School in [566]St. Louis County was renamed
   [567]Lindbergh High School. The school newspaper is the Pilot, the
   yearbook is the Spirit, the students are known as the Flyers, and the
   school's marching band holds the title of the Spirit of St. Louis
   Marching Band. The school district was also later named after
   Lindbergh. The stretch of US 67 that runs through most of the [568]St.
   Louis metro area is called "Lindbergh Blvd." Lindbergh also has a star
   on the [569]St. Louis Walk of Fame.^[[570]citation needed]

   In Lindbergh's hometown of Little Falls, Minnesota, one of the
   district's elementary schools is named Charles Lindbergh Elementary.
   The district's sports teams are named the Flyers and Lindbergh Drive is
   a major road on the west side of town, leading to [571]Charles A.
   Lindbergh State Park. The Lindberghs donated their farmstead to the
   state to be used as a park in memory of Lindbergh's father.^[572][110]
   The original Lindbergh residence is maintained as a museum, the Charles
   A. Lindbergh Historic Site, and is listed as a [573]National Historic
   Landmark.^[574][111]

   Lindbergh is a recipient of the [575]Silver Buffalo Award, the highest
   adult award given by the [576]Boy Scouts of America.^[[577]citation
   needed]

   On May 2, 2002, Lindbergh's grandson, [578]Erik Lindbergh, celebrated
   the 75th anniversary of the pioneering 1927 flight of the Spirit of Ft.
   Louis by duplicating the journey in a single engine, two seat
   [579]Lancair Columbia 200. The younger Lindbergh's solo flight from
   [580]Republic Airport on [581]Long Island, to [582]Le Bourget Airport
   in Paris was completed in 17 hours and 7 minutes, or just a little more
   than half the time of his grandfather's 33.5 hour original
   hop..^[[583]citation needed]

   After his transatlantic flight, Lindbergh wrote a letter to the
   director of [584]Longines, describing in detail a watch which would
   make navigation easier for pilots. The watch was manufactured to his
   design and is still produced today.^[[585]citation needed]

   In February 2002 the [586]Medical University of South Carolina at
   Charleston, within the celebrations for the Lindbergh 100th birthday
   established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize,^[587][112] given to major
   contributors to "development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies
   for organ preservation and growth". M. E. DeBakey and 9 other
   scientists^[588][113] received the prize, a bronze statuette espressly
   created for the event by the Italian artist C. Zoli and named
   "Elisabeth"^[589][114] after Elisabeth Morrow, sister of Lindbergh's
   wife Anne Morrow, died as a result of heart disease. Lindbergh in fact
   was disappointed that contemporary medical technology could not provide
   an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her and
   that gave the occasion for the first contact between Carrel and
   Lindbergh.^[[590]citation needed]

[[591]edit] Awards and decorations

   Lindbergh received many awards, medals and decorations, most of which
   were later donated to the Missouri Historical Society and are on

          For displaying heroic courage and skill as a navigator, at the
          risk of his life, by his nonstop flight in his airplane, the
          "Spirit of St. Louis", from New York City to Paris, France,
          20–21 May 1927, by which Capt. Lindbergh not only achieved the
          greatest individual triumph of any American citizen but
          demonstrated that travel across the ocean by aircraft was
          possible.^[616][116]

   Until World War II, the Medal of Honor was also authorized to be
   awarded for extraordinarily heroic actions by active or reserve service
   members made during [617]peacetime as well as in combat.^[[618]citation

[[619]edit] Legacy

   The controversy surrounding his involvement in politics (and to a
   lesser extent, his personal life) sometimes overshadows the fact that
   he was an important pioneer in aviation from the 1920s to the 1950s.
   His 1927 flight made him the first international celebrity in the age
   of mass media. One U.S. Air Force general remembers Lindbergh's
   critical view of his own legacy. In the late 1940s, Lindbergh visited
   U.S. Air Force bases to evaluate American air power (of which he was a
   staunch supporter) in relation to the emerging [620]Cold War. During
   this trip, he remarked "I think my flight to Paris came too soon for
   the civilizations of the world. They were suddenly thrown together by
   air travel and they weren't quite ready for it."^[621][117]

[[622]edit] Popular culture

   A wall-mounted quote by Charles Augustus Lindbergh in [623]The American
   Adventure in the World Showcase pavilion of [624]Walt Disney World's
   [625]Epcot

   Lindbergh's life has spurred the imaginations of many writers and
   others; the following list provides a summary of notable popular
   cultural references:
     * Charles Lindbergh was selected as [626]Time Magazine's [627]Man of
       the Year in 1927, becoming the first holder of that title. As of
       2010, Lindbergh remains the youngest individual (age 25) to be
       named Person of the Year.^[628][118]
     * A song called "[629]Lindbergh (The Eagle of the U.S.A.)" was
       released soon after the 1927 flight. A multitude of songs with
       "Lucky Lindy" in the title were released in the aftermath of the
       Atlantic crossing. [630]Tony Randall revived the song "Lucky Lindy"
       in an album of [631]Jazz Age and [632]Depression-era songs that he
       recorded entitled Vo Vo De Oh Doe (1967).^[633][119]
     * The dance craze the "[634]Lindy Hop" became popular after his
       flight, and was named after him.^[[635]citation needed]
     * In 1929, [636]Bertold Brecht wrote a musical called Der
       Lindberghflug (Lindbergh's Flight) with music by [637]Kurt Weill
       and [638]Paul Hindemith. In 1950 because of Lindbergh's apparent
       Nazi sympathies Brecht removed all direct references to Lindbergh,
       and renamed the piece [639]Der Ozeanflug (The Ocean Flight).
     * [640]Woody Guthrie wrote a song called "Lindbergh" on The Asch
       Recordings Vol. 1 recorded in the 1940s. The song was
       anti-Lindbergh, and included the line "they say America First but
       they mean America Next."^[[641]citation needed]

[[642]edit] Books

   "WE" — First Edition (1927)

   Charles Lindbergh wrote two best-selling books about the Spirit of St.
   Louis and his flight from New York to Paris. The first of these, "WE",
   was published by [643]G.P. Putnam's Sons^[644][N 5] in July 1927—a
   little more than two months after the historic flight—as both an
   "instant" autobiography of the suddenly world famous young aviator, and
   to provide his detailed first-person account of the Ryan monoplane's
   conception, design, construction and transatlantic flight from New York
   to Paris. (Originally ghostwritten by The New York Times reporter
   Carlyle MacDonald, Lindbergh was so dissatisfied with the manuscript's
   "fawning tone" that he completely rewrote it himself in a period of
   three weeks in late June and early July 1927.^[645][120]) The book's
   simple one-word "flying pronoun" title refers to Lindbergh's view of a
   deep "spiritual" partnership that had developed "between himself and
   his airplane during the dark hours of his flight."^[646][121] In 1953
   Lindbergh published [647]The Spirit of St. Louis, a second, far more
   detailed account of the project which the following year garnered the
   [648]1954 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction (autobiography).

   In addition to aviation, Lindbergh also wrote prolifically over the
   years on other topics of interest to him including science, technology,
   nationalism, war, materialism, and values. Included among those
   writings were five other books: The Culture of Organs (with [649]Dr.
   Alexis Carrel) (1938), Of Flight and Life (1948), The Wartime Journals
   of Charles A. Lindbergh (1970), Boyhood on the Upper Mississippi
   (1972), and his final book, Autobiography of Values, which was
   published posthumously in 1978.^[650][122]
   The first of 20 Ted Scott Flying Stories (1927)

   Lindbergh also influenced or was the model for characters in a variety
   of works of fiction. Shortly after he made his famous flight, the
   [651]Stratemeyer Syndicate began publishing a series of books for
   juvenile readers called the [652]Ted Scott Flying Stories (1927–1943)
   which were written by a number of authors all using the [653]nom de
   plume of "[654]Franklin W. Dixon", in which the pilot hero was closely
   modeled after Lindbergh. (Ted Scott duplicated the solo flight to Paris
   in the series' first volume, entitled Over the Ocean to Paris published
   in 1927.) Another fictional literary reference to Lindbergh appears in
   the [655]Agatha Christie book (1934) and movie [656]Murder on the
   Orient Express (1974) which begins with a fictionalized depiction of
   the [657]Lindbergh baby kidnapping.

   In Eric Norden's alternate history novel [658]The Ultimate Solution
   (1973), Norden speculates that Lindbergh would have been president of a
   Nazi-occupied American [659]puppet state. The [660]Philip Roth novel
   [661]The Plot Against America (2004) is a speculative fiction novel
   which explores an alternate history where [662]Franklin Delano
   Roosevelt is defeated in the 1940 presidential election by Charles
   Lindbergh, who allies the United States with Nazi
   Germany.^[[663]citation needed]

[[664]edit] Film

   Verdensberømtheder i København (1939)^[665][123] was a Danish
   [666]short subject produced by the Dansk Film Co.^[667][124] in which
   Charles Lindbergh as well as Hollywood actors [668]Robert Taylor,
   [669]Myrna Loy, and [670]Edward G. Robinson all appeared as themselves.
   The 1938 [671]Paramount film Men with Wings ([672]Fred MacMurray,
   [673]Ray Milland) featured a replica of the Spirit of St. Louis
   fashioned from a Ryan B-1 "Brougham"^[674][125] similar to one
   presented to Lindbergh by the manufacturer, the Mahoney Aircraft
   Corporation, shortly after the Spirit was retired in April
   1928.^[675][126] The 1942 [676]MGM picture [677]Keeper of the Flame
   ([678]Katharine Hepburn, [679]Spencer Tracy) features Hepburn as the
   widow of Robert V. Forrest, a "Lindbergh-like" national
   hero,^[680][127] who was exposed after his death as a secret fascist
   intending to use his influence—especially over America's youth—to turn
   the country into a fascist state and eliminate those he deemed as
   inferior races.

   Four years after its 1953 publication, Lindbergh's second book about
   his flying "partner" served as the basis for the namesake major
   Hollywood [681]Cinemascope motion picture [682]The Spirit of St. Louis,
   directed by [683]Billy Wilder and released on April 20, 1957, one month
   short of the 30th anniversary of the flight to Paris. The Spirit was
   "portrayed" in the film by three [684]flyable replicas of the Ryan NYP,
   while Lindbergh was played^[685][N 6]by veteran American actor and
   fellow Army aviator<^[686][N 7][687]James Stewart.

   Lindbergh has also been the subject of numerous screen, television, and
   other documentary films over the years, including Charles A. Lindbergh
   (1927), a UK documentary by De Forest Phonofilm based on Lindbergh's
   milestone flight, 40,000 Miles with Lindbergh (1928) featuring Charles
   A. Lindbergh, and The American Experience—Lindbergh: The Shocking,
   Turbulent Life of America's Lone Eagle (1988) [688]PBS documentary
   directed by Stephen Ives.^[[689]citation needed]

[[690]edit] Postage stamps

   Scott C-10 and #1710 with May 20, 1977 First Day of Issue CDS

   Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit have been honored by a variety of
   world postage stamps over the last eight decades including two issued
   by the United States. Less than three weeks after the flight the
   [691]U.S. Post Office Department issued a 10-cent "Lindbergh Air Mail"
   stamp (Scott C-10) on June 11, 1927 with engraved illustrations of both
   the Spirit of St. Louis and a map of its route from New York to Paris.
   (This was also the first U.S. stamp to bear the name of a living
   person.) A half-century later, a 13-Cent commemorative stamp (Scott
   #1710) depicting the Spirit flying low over the Atlantic Ocean was
   issued on May 20, 1977, the 50th anniversary of the flight from
   [692]Roosevelt Field.
