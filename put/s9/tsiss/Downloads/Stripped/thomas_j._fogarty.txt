              Thomas P. Fogarty
      Born     February 25, 1934(1934-02-25)
               [11]Cincinnati, Ohio
    Residence  California
   Nationality Irish American

   Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty (born in [12]Cincinnati, Ohio on February 25,
   1934) is an [13]American surgeon and inventor of the [14]embolectomy
   [15]catheter. Before his invention the success rate for removing an
   [16]embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. In 1963, Dr.
   Thomas Fogarty published an article describing "a new method for
   extraction of arterial emboli and thrombi."^[17][1]

   The balloon embolectomy catheter was used on a human patient for the
   first time six weeks after Fogarty came up with the idea in 1961.
   Today, using only [18]local anesthesia, the procedure only takes about
   an hour.

   Fogarty’s [19]inventions and the many others that resulted from his
   original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way [20]surgery
   was performed. When asked about the time the impact his invention had
   on the field, he says, "I had no concept that [non-invasive surgery]
   would reach the magnitude that it has."^[21][2] As a result of the
   invention, Dr. Fogarty, still alive today, went on to win many prizes
   and patent over sixty inventions.

[[35]edit] Early life and education

   On February 25, 1934, Fogarty was born into a poor, [36]Irish Catholic
   family as the youngest of three children living in [37]Cincinnati. His
   father worked as a railroad engineer, but he died when Fogarty was just
   eight years old.

   Fogarty assumed a role of greater responsibility at a young age, but,
   as he points out later in life, his father’s absence also nurtured his
   own creative nature as an inventor. He fixed things that his mother
   needed fixed, and he worked with [38]soapbox derby cars and [39]model
   airplanes. "I just had a natural inclination and inquisitive nature
   about building things. I looked at things and just naturally thought,
   'Okay, how can I make this better?'"^[40][2] His business side was
   evident in childhood as well. The model airplanes that he built were
   sold to neighborhood kids. When he became frustrated with motor scooter
   gears, he built and sold a [41]centrifugal clutch.

   As for Fogarty’s educational background, he was not a top-notch
   student, and his original career goal was to be a boxer. “I wasn’t a
   very good kid. They sent me to a camp to keep me out of trouble. One of
   the routine activities was boxing. I became the Midwest [42]Golden
   Glove champ.”^[43][3]

   To help his family get by in the late 1940s, fourteen-year old Fogarty
   started working at [44]Good Samaritan Hospital during a time when
   hospitals were still exempt from [45]child labor laws. He began the job
   cleaning medical equipment in the eighth grade, but he continued
   working during his high school summer vacations and was soon promoted
   to scrub technician, a person who handed medical instruments to
   surgeons.

   During his last year of high school, Fogarty discovered that he wanted
   to be a doctor. At the age of 17, he quit his boxing career after he
   broke his nose in a match that ended in a draw. A family priest gave
   him a recommendation, and because of his awful grades, he was admitted
   to Cincinnati’s [46]Xavier University on probation. In order to get
   through college, Fogarty took on three jobs and received financial
   assistance from Dr. Jack Cranley, Fogarty’s mentor and one of the most
   prominent vascular surgeons in the United States. Fogarty was Cranley’s
   private scrub technician at Good Samaritan Hospital. “I had a mentor
   who encouraged me and helped to persuade me to go to college…He had 10
   kids and I became the 11th. He always told me, ‘You are smarter than
   you think.’”^[47][3]

   Fogarty graduated from Xavier University with a bachelor’s degree in
   biology in 1956 and went on to attend the Cincinnati College of
   Medicine where he graduated in 1960. From 1960 to 1961, he interned at
   the [48]University of Oregon Medical School in [49]Portland, Oregon,
   and he completed his surgical residency at the same school in 1965.

[[50]edit] Invention of the embolectomy catheter

   During Fogarty’s years at Good Samaritan Hospital, he witnessed the
   deaths of many patients who died from complications in blood clot
   surgeries in their limbs. “Fifty percent of the patients died. I
   thought there must be a better way.”^[51][4] Before Fogarty’s
   invention, surgeons had to use forceps to remove the blood clots only
   after a huge part of an [52]artery had been cut open, and the patient
   would be under [53]general anesthesia for hours. Blood flow is usually
   interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing
   a limb.^[54][5]

   At home, the ideas that went through Fogarty’s head concerned different
   ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on
   avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a urethral catheter and
   a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small
   incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to
   the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough
   to be pushed through a blood [55]clot. As for the balloon, he basically
   cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical [56]latex
   glove and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter. The
   resulting balloon could be inflated with saline using a [57]syringe,
   and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted,
   withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.

   The main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could
   be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold [58]vinyl, the
   material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was
   not available. Fogarty’s own take on the catheter came about because of
   [59]fly fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying
   was needed in fly fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the
   balloon to the catheter. "I'd always tied flies and made lures so it
   was just a natural thing."^[60][2] His experimental balloon catheter,
   however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even
   broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with [61]Jell-o, a
   model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he
   figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when
   inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through
   without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD
   from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first [62]minimally
   invasive surgical device.

   Fogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to
   produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. "Companies
   thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any
   credibility."^[63][6] Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon,
   during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961
   and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for
   himself and for other vascular surgeons.

   At the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency
   in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used
   Fogarty’s balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was
   willing to manufacture Fogarty’s device, he asked one of his
   acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of
   his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In
   1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from
   Irvine, California, was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the
   Fogarty embolectomy catheter.

   Because of the decreased risk associated with the device, it became the
   industry standard. It is still the most widely used catheter for
   blood-clot removal today and has been used in over three hundred
   thousand procedures every year all over the world.^[64][7] It is
   estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately fifteen
   million patients.

[[65]edit] Other inventions

   Numerous sequel applications of Fogarty’s catheter came about. The
   first balloon [66]angioplasty, for example, was performed with a
   Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty
   thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his
   catheter to less invasive [67]biopsy techniques.

   After completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon,
   Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices as a holder of more
   than 60 patents, with more still pending. Based on many of the devices
   founded in his own Fogarty Engineering, Inc., around twenty companies
   have been started.

   One of Fogarty’s most successful products is the [68]Stent-Graft. This
   dealt with the difficult problem of [69]abdominal aortic aneurysms,
   which is a term referring to a weakened [70]blood vessel. The old
   method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but
   Fogarty’s idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a
   thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. An catheter
   transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon
   is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and
   blood flows normally.

[[71]edit] Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards

   In 1969, when he began teaching surgery at the [72]Stanford University
   Medical Center, Fogarty was first introduced to the wine industry. He
   helped out a Stanford colleague’s small winery with vineyard and cellar
   practices. Later on, he purchased land in the Santa Cruz Mountains. He
   established a cellar there and began making wine with grapes bought
   from nearby growers. He planted his first vines in 1978 and set up a
   commercial winery, Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards, in 1981. The
   estate now consists of three hundred twenty-five acres. Fifteen
   thousand cases of wine are produced annually.

   Fogarty’s basis for [73]winemaking also stems from his explanation that
   certain elements in the extracts from grape skin relax the blood
   vessels and lower the affinity for blood to clot.

   Of the wines produced in Fogarty’s vineyard, the 2004 SCM Lexington
   Meritage wine received “double gold” status in the San Francisco
   International Wine Competition in 2008, and the 2005 Santa Cruz
   Mountains Chardonnay was the gold medal winner and the “Best Chardonnay
   of Class” in the 2008 San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition.

[[74]edit] Three Arch Partners

   Fogarty, along with Mark Wan and Wilfred Jaeger, co-founded a
   [75]venture capital firm called Three Arch Partners in Portola Valley,
   California, in 1993. Wan and Jaeger both had noteworthy experience in
   the venture capitalism field, but it was Fogarty’s prestige that caused
   the firm to grow.

   Three Arch Partners focused on early stage medical device companies and
   has helped with the growth of more than fifty new [76]healthcare
   companies. It manages over one billion dollars in capital.

   In 2004, however, Fogarty was fired from the firm. He was let go due to
   issues pertaining to the amount of time Fogarty devoted to the firm.
   His time spent teaching, making wine, and working Fogarty Engineering,
   Inc. contributed to this decision. “It’s like giving birth to a child,
   but then having to leave it behind, which is hurtful, but I’ve been
   kicked of better places than [Three Arch], and I wouldn’t say that I
   wish them well.”^[77][8]

[[78]edit] The Fogarty Institute for Innovation

   Fogarty left Stanford Medical School after about fourteen years as a
   professor and practicing cardiovascular surgeon. In September 2007, at
   Mountain View, California, in [79]Silicon Valley, he founded the Thomas
   Fogarty Institute for [80]Innovation. It occupies forty-five hundred
   square feet of offices and engineering labs on the campus of [81]El
   Camino Hospital. The educational, non-profit organization mentors and
   trains medical innovators. The idea for the institution dates back to
   Fogarty’s early life when he received encouragement from Dr. Jack
   Cranley.

   “We are teaching people (doctors and engineers) how to get their
   concepts and products into use. Very few have gone through the process
   of coming up with a concept and getting it funded. That does not come
   naturally. It comes through experience. We will teach how to address
   these challenges.”^[82][3] Physician innovators, including Fogarty,
   serve as the faculty of the Institute and make use of their networks
   and experiences in the private industry to help those with projects
   that are ready for [83]commercialization.
