   Val Allen Browning (August 20, 1895 – May 16, 1994)^[20][1] was a noted
   [21]Utah industrialist, philanthropist, and third generation gun
   innovator. His grandfather, [22]Jonathan Browning, opened a gun shop in
   [23]Ogden, Utah in 1852 and his father, [24]John Browning, is
   considered by many to be the most important gun inventor in history.

[[29]edit] Life

   Born in [30]Ogden, Utah on 20 August 1895, Val Browning graduated from
   [31]Ogden High School in 1913 and later studied law and engineering at
   [32]Cornell University.

   In 1918, Val Browning was commissioned as a second lieutenant with the
   [33]United States Army, and served with the 79th American Division at
   [34]Verdun. In 1920, he became the manager of the manufacturing of
   [35]John Browning guns in [36]Liege, [37]Belgium, and served as his
   father's personal representative to the [38]Fabrique Nationale de
   Herstal company. Upon his father's death in 1926, Val had the
   responsibility of completing the projects that were not finished by his
   father, including the [39]Browning Superposed shotgun and the
   [40]Browning Hi-Power pistol (GP-35).

   In 1924, he married Ann Chaffin (1901-1975) of [41]Farmington, Utah and
   they had four children. They lived in [42]Belgium until 1935 when Val
   returned to [43]Utah as President of [44]Browning Arms Company.

   Val received 48 gun patents during his career, compared to his father
   [45]John Browning's 128 American gun patents. In 1955, Val Browning was
   awarded Knighthood in the [46]Order of Léopold by [47]King Baudouin of
   [48]Belgium for an "outstanding contribution to the Gun Making Art;" an
   honor that had been bestowed upon his father in 1914.

   Mr. Browning spent his career representing business interests in the
   United States and Europe. In addition to chairing Browning Arms, he
   served as director of the First Security Corporation, [49]Utah
   International, [50]Amalgamated Sugar Company, and the Mountain Fuel
   Supply Company. Through the 1940's purchase of some of the shares of W.
   L. Wattis of his founding shares in [51]Utah Construction Company, Val
   Browning shared in the substantial gains in the sale of [52]Utah
   International. Val Browning was a benefactor of the [53]Dixie State
   College of Utah and [54]Weber State University and his donation of his
   substantial collection of European fine art formed the basis of the
   [55]Utah Museum of Fine Arts masterwork paintings.

   Browning died in 1994 in [56]Ogden, Utah.
