[[16]edit] Early life

   Thompson was born in [17]Union, Maine on November 25, 1835. In the
   early part of the [18]American Civil War, he joined the Union Army
   forces as [19]captain of Company G, [20]28th Maine Volunteer Infantry.
   He saw action in the [21]Siege of Port Hudson in [22]Donaldsonville,
   Louisiana as well as minor action at [23]Fort Pickens in [24]Pensacola,
   Florida.^[25][1] Later in life he was granted the rank of lieutenant
   colonel through an act of Congress.^[26][2]^[27][3]

   After the war ended, he went on to attend [28]Hahnemann Homeopathia
   College and graduated with honors at the head of his class. Upon
   graduation he settled in [29]Lowell, Massachusetts where he set up his
   medical practice in 1867. By 1885, Dr. Thompson's practice had become
   highly successful and he was said to have one of the largest patient
   lists in [30]New England.^[31][2]^[32][3] However it was at this time
   he gave up his [33]$15,000 (over [34]$350,000 by 2009 standards) to
   begin the marketing and sale of his [35]Moxie nerve
   tonic.^[36][2]^[37][3]

[[38]edit] Business

   The tonic, based upon his original patent medicine "Nerve Food" created
   in 1876, was first released as a syrup in 1884. In 1885, he received a
   trade mark for the term and released it as a carbonated beverage.

   There had been a lawsuit in 1907 complained by The Moxie Nerve Food
   Company of New England against Modox Company and others for copying the
   ingredients and using the name of "Modox"^[39][4] which closely
   resembled "Moxie" and infringing on their patents and
   trademarks.^[40][5] The complaint was dismissed regretfully by the
   judge who said the court could not protect the legitimate part of the
   complainant's business in this case. In a later case in New York, the
   Moxie Nerve Food Company won the complaint against Modox which
   subsequently went out of business.^[41][4]
