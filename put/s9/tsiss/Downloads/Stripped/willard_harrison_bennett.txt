   Willard Harrison Bennett (June 13, 1903 – September 28, 1987) was a
   [13]scientist and [14]inventor, born in [15]Findlay, [16]Ohio. Bennett
   conducted research into [17]plasma physics, [18]astrophysics,
   [19]geophysics, [20]surface physics, and [21]physical chemistry. The
   [22]Bennett pinch is named after him.

[[23]edit] Biography

   Born in [24]Findlay, Ohio, Bennett attended [25]Carnegie Institute of
   Technology from 1920-22 and [26]Ohio State University; the
   [27]University of Wisconsin–Madison, Sc.M. in physical chemistry, 1926;
   and the [28]University of Michigan, Ph.D. in physics, 1928. Bennett was
   elected to a National Research Fellowship in Physics and in 1928 and
   1929 studied at the [29]California Institute of Technology. In 1930 he
   joined the Physics faculty at Ohio State. Following service in
   [30]World War II, Bennett worked at the National Bureau of Standards,
   the [31]University of Arkansas, and the [32]United States Naval
   Research Laboratory. In 1961, he was appointed Burlington Professor of
   Physics at [33]North Carolina State University (emeritus in 1976).
   Bennett held 67 [34]patents.

   Bennett made scientific history in the 1930s pioneering studies in
   plasma physics - the study of gases ionized by high-voltage
   electricity. Bennett invented [35]radio [36]frequency [37]mass
   spectrometry in (1955). Bennett's radio frequency mass spectrometer
   measured the masses of atoms. It was the first such experiment in
   space. He also researched gases ionized by high voltage electricity.
   This research was used in later [38]thermonuclear fusion research.

[[39]edit] Invention impact

   These studies and later research have been used throughout the world in
   controlled [40]thermonuclear fusion research. In the 1950s, Bennett's
   experimental tube called the Stormertron predicted and modeled the
   [41]Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the earth six years before
   they were discovered by satellite. It also reproduced intricate impact
   patterns found on the Earth's surface which explained many features of
   the polar aurora. [42]Sputnik 3 carried the first radio frequency mass
   spectrometer into space.
