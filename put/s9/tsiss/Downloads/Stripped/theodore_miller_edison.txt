[[17]edit] Biography

   He was born on July 10, 1898 at Glenmont, the Edison home in
   [18]Llewellyn Park in [19]West Orange, New Jersey. He attended [20]The
   Haverford School in [21]Haverford, Pennsylvania, and later the
   [22]Montclair Academy in [23]Montclair, New Jersey. He graduated in
   1916.^[24][1]^[25][2] Theodore ended his education at [26]Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology. He earned a physics degree in 1923 and
   remained there another year to pursue graduate studies.^[27][3]

   In 1925 he married Anna Maria (Ann) Osterhout, a graduate of Vassar
   College.^[28][4]

   After graduation, Theodore worked for his father's company, [29]Thomas
   A. Edison, Inc., starting as a lab assistant. He later founded his own
   company, [30]Calibron Industries, Inc., and built his own smaller
   laboratory in West Orange. He earned over 80 [31]patents in his career.

   In later years he became an ardent [32]environmentalist, opponent of
   the [33]Vietnam War and advocate of [34]Zero Population Growth. He
   lived in [35]West Orange, New Jersey until he died on November 24,
   1992.^[36][5]
