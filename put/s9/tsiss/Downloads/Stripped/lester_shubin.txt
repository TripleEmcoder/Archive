   Lester D. Shubin (September 27, 1925 - November 20, 2009) was a
   researcher who developed [9]Kevlar for the use in [10]ballistic vests.
   Kevlar's use in ballistic vests was later expanded for use in all types
   of [11]personal armor.

[[12]edit] Life

   Shubin was born in [13]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and graduated from
   South Philadelphia High School in 1943. He served in the [14]U.S. Army
   during [15]World War II. After the war, Shubin worked as a chemist and
   joined the [16]U.S. Department of Justice in 1971.^[17][1]

   Shubin worked for many years at the National Institute of Justice
   ("NIJ"), the federal agency designated with research and development in
   the field of law enforcement technology. At least one history of the
   development of police technology notes that in its first 20 years,
   "efforts in technology research and development were to a considerable
   degree a one-person effort, that person being Lester Shubin, a
   chemist."^[18][2]

   In 1966, [19]Stephanie Kwolek, a chemist working for E.I. DuPont de
   Nemours & Co., developed Kevlar; a strong, lightweight liquid polymer
   that can be spun into a fiber and woven into cloth.^[20][3] Kevlar was
   initially used as a replacement for steel-belting in tires, and later
   for use in ropes, gaskets, and automotive and aviation
   parts.^[21][1]^[22][3] In 1971, Shubin, who was then the Director of
   Science and Technology for the National Institute for Law Enforcement
   and Criminal Justice,^[23][4] suggested using Kevlar to replace nylon
   in bullet-proof vests.^[24][3]^[25][5] Prior to the introduction of
   Kevlar, [26]flak jackets made of nylon had provided much more limited
   protection to users. Shubin later recalled how the idea developed: "We
   folded it over a couple of times and shot at it. The bullets didn't go
   through."^[27][1] Shubin received a $5 million grant to research the
   use of the fabric in bullet-proof vests.

   In 1975, the federal government distributed 5,000 Kevlar vests to 15
   police departments. In the first year of deployment, two police
   officers wearing the vests were shot with handguns and two others were
   attacked with knives. None of the assaulted officers suffered any
   serious injuries. The first instance of a Kevlar vest saving a police
   officer from a bullet occurred on December 23, 1975, when a Seattle
   police officer was shot in the chest during a grocery store
   robbery.^[28][6] Shubin later recalled travelling to Seattle to observe
   the results of the vest: "He was shot from only three feet away and he
   didn't even fall down, so the guy shot him again. We rushed out to
   Seattle to see him. All he had under the vest was two mean looking
   bruises."^[29][6]

   In the 30-plus years since Shubin introduced the Kevlar bullet-proof
   vest, the vests have been credited with saving the lives of more than
   3,000 law enforcement officers.^[30][1]

   Shubin was also an early advocate of using bomb-sniffing dogs to find
   explosives. He recalled, "We learned that basically any dog could find
   explosives or drugs, even very small dogs like Chihuahuas, whose size
   could be an advantage. Who is going to look twice at someone in a fur
   coat carrying a dog? But that dog could smell a bomb as well as a
   German shepherd."^[31][1]

   Shubin died of a heart attack in November 20, 2009 at the age of
   84.^[32][7] Following Shubin's death, The Police News paid tribute to
   Shubin for the many lives he had saved through his development of the
   Kevlar vest:

     "Many of us had the honor of meeting Lester D. Shubin during an
     event in Washington, DC. ... There are literally thousands of police
     officers alive today that can trace their survival back to Mr.
     Shubin's work. Please take a moment to remember the life of Lester
     D. Shubin, 1925 - 2009."^[33][8]

   Lester is survived by his wife, Zelda, his son, Harry B. Shubin, his
   daughter-in-law, Julie Shubin and his two grandchildren, Rachel and
   Michael Shubin.
