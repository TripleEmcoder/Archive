   Edward Andrew Deeds (March 12, 1874 – July 1, 1960) was an [11]American
   engineer, inventor and industrialist prominent in the [12]Dayton, Ohio
   area.

[[13]edit] Biography

   Born in 1874 near [14]Granville, Ohio, he graduated in 1897 from
   [15]Denison University where he was [16]valedictorian. He studied
   [17]electrical engineering at [18]Cornell University and later went to
   [19]Dayton, Ohio as an electrical engineer and draftsman for the
   Thresher Company, designing and installing electric motors. After
   eighteen months, he was named superintendent and chief engineer of the
   firm.

   The [20]National Cash Register Company was headquartered in the same
   building as the Thresher Company and in 1899, Frederick Patterson
   invited Deeds to join "the Cash" to strengthen its team. There he
   oversaw the electrification of the NCR factories and built its first
   electric generating station.

   He married Edith M. Walton (1870-1949) about 1900.

   He left NCR to build the [21]Shredded Wheat factory, known as the
   Palace of Light, for [22]Henry Perky at [23]Niagara Falls. The factory
   was white-tiled, air-conditioned, well-lit, and equipped with showers,
   lunchrooms, and auditoriums for the employees and clearly was
   influenced by Deeds' exposure to the ideas of [24]John H. Patterson at
   NCR. The Palace of Light preceded the Pure Food and Drug Act's
   requirements for a clean work environment for food production by 6
   years. Deeds was a director of Perky's National Food Company.

   In 1903 he returned to NCR as chief of development and construction.
   Deeds constructed some prototype electric motors to demonstrate that
   they could be used to power cash registers. He hired [25]Charles F.
   Kettering to prove the concept and three years later, Kettering had a
   working production model which revolutionized the register business and
   established National Cash Register as the dominant manufacturer
   worldwide for decades. Deeds oversaw the establishment of NCR factories
   in England, France, Italy, Germany and Canada. In February 1913, Deeds
   was convicted of violations of the [26]Sherman Antitrust Act along with
   [27]John H. Patterson, [28]Thomas J. Watson and 25 other NCR executives
   and managers. He was sentenced to one year, but the sentence was never
   served as the convictions were successfully appealed.

   Kettering and Deeds had a lifelong professional relationship and
   friendship. Deeds provided space in one of his barns for Kettering to
   work on an electric starter for automobiles. In 1909, [29]Henry Leland
   of the [30]Cadillac Company ordered 5,000 ignition sets and Deeds and
   Kettering formed the Dayton Engineering Laboratories company,
   [31]Delco. Delco was eventually sold to United Motors Company which was
   later acquired by [32]General Motors. Deeds was a member of the board
   of United Motors.

   The Delco brand name was associated with original production units of
   the company such as Delco Light, Delco Products, Delco Moraine and
   others, and was also adopted into other General Motors units such as
   Delco-Remy and others. The research laboratories of Delco became the
   foundation for the General Motors Research Corporation.

   Deeds contributed to the rebuilding of Dayton and formation of the
   [33]Miami Conservancy District after the [34]Great Dayton Flood of
   1913. In 1914, Deeds and Kettering founded the [35]Engineers Club of
   Dayton.

   Deeds left NCR in 1915 to devote full attention to Delco.

   He founded the [36]Dayton-Wright Airplane Company with [37]Orville
   Wright, [38]H. E. Talbott, and Kettering. Deeds was appointed Chief of
   Aircraft Production in Washington D.C. The Delco plant in [39]Moraine,
   Ohio was expanded to manufacture the [40]DeHavilland [41]DH.4 bomber,
   the only American-built airplane to see action in [42]World War I. More
   than 3,000 were built in Moraine. The company produced the [43]Liberty
   engine. In 1917, he joined the [44]United States Army with the rank of
   colonel, taking the responsibility for military aircraft procurement at
   [45]McCook Field, precursor to [46]Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

   Colonel Deeds was also one of the founding members of the Dayton
   Astronomical Society (DAS), the first formally organized group of
   amateur astronomers in the Dayton area, founded in 1918. After the war,
   Deeds returned to Delco.

   In 1922, Deeds was instrumental in reorganizing over 100 Cuban sugar
   companies into General Sugar Company, from which he retired as chairman
   in 1946.

   During the Depression in 1931, Deeds returned to NCR to restore
   shareholder confidence, serving as its President until 1940 and
   honorary chairman until his retirement in 1957.

   Deeds, Kettering, and newspaper magnate and politician [47]James M. Cox
   all built magnificent homes near each other south of [48]Dayton, Ohio
   in what later became [49]Kettering, Ohio. Deeds' home, today owned by
   the [Kettering Health Network], was called Moraine Farm and was the
   first home in the United States to have a private airstrip. The home
   also includes an observatory that houses a 7" refractor telescope.

   The [50]Art moderne-style Carillon tower in [51]Carillon Historical
   Park, titled Deeds Carillon, was built in 1942, funded by his wife
   Edith Walton Deeds and was designed to commemorate the Deeds family.
   When the tower was built, each of 23 bells was inscribed with the name
   of a family member, with the "silent" bells bearing the names of
   deceased family members and ringing bells cast with the names of family
   members then living. Today, with 57 bells, the [52]carillon is Ohio's
   largest. The historical elements of the park were the brainchild of
   Deeds himself.

   Deeds died at his home, Moraine Farm, in 1960. He is buried at
   [53]Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio.^[54][1]
