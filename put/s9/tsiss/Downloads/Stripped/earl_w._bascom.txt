[[44]edit] Childhood

   Earl Bascom was born in a sod-roofed [45]log cabin on the Bascom 101
   Ranch in [46]Vernal, [47]Utah. His father, John W. Bascom, had been a
   deputy [48]sheriff in Utah who chased [49]Butch Cassidy and the Wild
   Bunch Gang. Both sets of Earl's grandparents (Joel A. Bascom and C.F.B.
   Lybbert) were [50]Mormon pioneers,^[51][1] ranchers and frontier
   lawmen.

   Earl Bascom's paternal ancestral background was a colorful aray of
   nationalities and ethnicities including [52]Quaker, French [53]Basque
   and [54]Huguenot, as well as an American [55]Colonial [56]Governor,
   John Webster, and a [57]Revolutionary War soldier, Oliver
   Greene.^[58][2] His maternal family was of [59]Norwegian, [60]Danish,
   [61]Dutch and [62]German ancestry.^[63][3] As a child growing up, he
   was sometimes affectionately addressed by his British-born aunts as
   "Lord Bascom - [64]King of the Canadian Cowboys," as he was a
   descendant of [65]European [66]royalty back to [67]Charlemagne.

   While Bascom was still a child his family moved to the Bascom Bar-B-3
   Ranch in [68]Alberta, [69]Canada. He quit school while in grade three
   to work on the Hyssop 5H Ranch. Although he was soon marched back to
   school by the [70]Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Earl was reprieved to
   get the job of driving an old [71]stagecoach each day to the
   surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from
   school.^[72][4]

[[73]edit] Cowboy

   Earl Bascom was known as the [74]Cowboy of Cowboy Artists due to his
   wide range of western experiences as a professional [75]bronc buster,
   [76]cowpuncher, trail driver, [77]blacksmith, freighter, [78]wolf
   hunter, [79]wild horse chaser, [80]rodeo champion, cattle rancher, dude
   [81]wrangler, and [82]Hollywood [83]actor.^[84][5] Bascom was among the
   last of those who experienced the [85]Old West before the end of
   free-range ranching. Bascom reminisced:
   “ I worked for some of the big open-range outfits from [86]Purple
     Springs to the [87]Sweetgrass Hills and [88]Kicking Horse Creek to the
     [89]Milk River Ridge and the [90]Canadian Rockies. On one roundup some
     7,000 horses were gathered in one bunch a mile wide. And the Knight
     Ranch dipped 18,000 head of cattle. What a sight to see. The sight, the
     sounds, the smell I can still remember.^[91][6]                        ”

[[92]edit] Professional cowboy

   For Earl [93]Bascom, ranch life and cowboy life was his life. "The life
   of a cowboy and the West, I know," he stated.^[94][7] Bascom worked on
   some of the largest horse and cattle ranches in the [95]United States
   and [96]Canada — ranches that ran thousands of [97]cattle on a million
   acres (4000 km²) of land. He broke and trained hundreds of horses. He
   worked on ranches where he chased and gathered [98]horses, [99]cows and
   even [100]donkeys in [101]Utah, [102]Arizona, [103]Colorado,
   [104]Idaho, [105]Wyoming, [106]Montana, [107]Mississippi,
   [108]Washington, [109]California and Canada. He worked on cattle drives
   out of the [110]Rockies and horse drives through the [111]Teton Range.
   He took part on large roundups of horses and cattle, and brandings. He
   made [112]saddles and [113]stirrups, [114]quirts, [115]chaps,
   [116]spurs, [117]bridles and [118]bits, [119]ropes and [120]hackamores,
   and even patched his own [121]boots.^[122][8] Earl's father, John W.
   Bascom, and Earl's brothers were all experienced ranch cowboys.

[[123]edit] Rodeo rider

   A professional rodeo cowboy, Earl Bascom rodeoed from 1916 to 1940 in
   the rough stock events of saddle bronc riding, bareback riding and
   [124]bull riding, and in the timed events of steer decorating and
   [125]steer wrestling.^[126][9] He also performed [127]trick
   riding.^[128][10] He held memberships in the [129]Cowboys Turtle
   Association, the [130]Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, the
   [131]Canadian Rodeo Cowboys Association (now the [132]Canadian Pro
   Rodeo Association) and the [133]National Police Rodeo Association. An
   all-around rodeo champion, he has been inducted into several rodeo
   [134]Halls of Fame in Canada and the United States. He received
   international acclaim for his rodeo equipment [135]inventions and
   [136]designs.^[137][11] Earl's brothers - Raymond "Tommy" Bascom,
   Melvin "High Pockets" Bascom and Weldon "Preacher" Bascom - were also
   professional rodeo cowboys and Hall of Fame inductees. These rodeos
   financed his education at [138]Brigham Young University until he
   graduated in 1940.^[139][12]

[[140]edit] Mississippi rodeo

   During his college years, Earl and his brother Weldon produced the
   first rodeos in [141]Columbia, Mississippi in 1935, 1936 and 1937 while
   working for Sam Hickman's B Bar H Ranch near Arm, Mississippi. Hickman
   financed these rodeos. Between rodeos of 1936 and 1937, Earl was a
   missionairy for the LDS Church in Mississippi serving under Mission
   President [142]LeGrand Richards of the Southern States Mission.

[[143]edit] Marriage

   In 1939, Earl married Nadine Diffey, who was part American Indian,
   [144]Creek and [145]Catawba. He met her in Mississippi while cowboying
   and rodeoing there. They were married in [146]Salt Lake City, Utah and
   raised five children. Later in life, [147]Nadine Bascom became a
   sculptor in her own right, creating [148]bas-relief sculptures.

[[149]edit] Rodeo clown

   Besides being a serious-minded rodeo contestant, Earl tried his hand as
   a [150]rodeo clown and [151]rodeo bullfighter during his rodeo career.
   Just after his 89th birthday, Earl was honored as the oldest living
   rodeo clown in the world.^[152][13]

[[153]edit] Artist

[[154]edit] Jim Thorpe's influence

   While working for the Nilsson Rafter-E-N Ranch, Earl happened to read a
   story in a western magazine about [155]Native American [156]Jim Thorpe.
   Thorpe had been working as a horse wrangler, but got fired. The camp
   cook gave him some advice - go to school. Thorpe took that advice, went
   to school, excelled in sports and became an [157]Olympic champion.

   Jim Thorpe’s life touched Earl Bascom’s. "I felt like I had walked in
   his boots," Earl said. "Like Jim Thorpe, cowboy life was the only life
   that I knew. But what about my art, what about art school?"^[158][14]

[[159]edit] Russell and Remington's influence

   Wanting to be an artist since childhood, Earl Bascom filled the pages
   of his school books in the one-room school house he attended with
   cowboy scenes. Earl Bascom’s desire to be a cowboy artist was greatly
   enhanced after seeing art works of the two great icons of [160]Old West
   art, [161]Charles M. Russell and [162]Frederic S. Remington - both
   cousins to Earl’s father (Remington and Russell were both related to
   Bascom through their mothers, Clarissa "Clara" Bascom Sackrider
   Remington and Mary Elizabeth Mead Russell, respectively). Charles
   Russell was on the Knight Ranch when Earl was working there, and had
   drawn a [163]sketch on the bunkhouse wall and also finished a large
   [164]oil painting of [165]Raymond Knight on his favorite mount, Blue
   Bird, roping a [166]steer.^[167][15]

   Earl only completed one full year of school and never finished
   [168]high school, but he never lost his desire to be an artist. He
   subscribed to a correspondence art course wherein both Russell and
   Remington gave instructions on their drawing techniques. "Through those
   art lessons these two masters of western art were my first real art
   teachers," Earl recalled. "In fact the only instructions I ever had in
   western art were from Remington and Russell."^[169][16]

[[170]edit] College art training

   Even though he had no high school diploma, the [171]Brigham Young
   University out of [172]Provo, Utah accepted him as a student in the
   fall of 1933. “There I was a 27 years old college freshman who hadn’t
   been to school in years,” Earl recalled. “I felt like a wild horse in a
   pen.”^[173][17] But his persistence was tough, taking every art course
   the college offered. He studied painting and drawing under professors
   [174]E.H. Eastmond and [175]B.F. Larsen, and sculpture under
   [176]Torlief Knaphus. Earl graduated from [177]B.Y.U. in 1940. Later he
   attended classes at [178]Long Beach City College, [179]Victor Valley
   College and the [180]University of California Riverside.

[[181]edit] Hollywood

   In 1917, Earl saw his first [182]Hollywood movie "The Silent Man" with
   [183]William S. Hart. Earl and his older brother Melvin were extras in
   a silent movie in 1920 being filmed in Lethbridge, Alberta. In 1924, a
   team of [184]palomino horses from the Bascom Ranch was used by
   [185]Hoot Gibson in the movie "The [186]Calgary Stampede." After
   graduating from college, Earl and his wife moved to [187]California.
   Retiring from rodeo, he pursued his art career and ranched. He worked a
   bit in the movie industry with his brother Weldon Bascom in the
   [188]Hollywood [189]western, "The Lawless Rider", starring Weldon's
   wife Texas Rose Bascom.^[190][18] Later Earl and his son-in-law Mel
   Marion did TV commercials with [191]Roy Rogers for the Roy Rogers
   Restaurant chain. Earl and his son [192]John Bascom were in the
   documentary "Take Willy With You" about the rodeo riding [193]Greenough
   family. When the Roy Rogers Riding Stables opened up in [194]Apple
   Valley, California, Earl and his son John worked there wrangling horses
   and driving the [195]hay [196]wagon.

[[197]edit] Art teacher

   In 1966, after getting his teaching certificate, Earl taught art
   classes at John F. Kennedy High School and at Barstow High School. He
   also served as president of the High Desert Artists, and later as
   president of the Buckaroo Artists of America. Among his art associates
   were Bill Bender, Charles LaMonk. Leslie B. DeMille, Glen Turner and
   Cecil Smith.

[[198]edit] International artist

   Earl Bascom became internationally known as a cowboy artist and
   sculptor. His art has been exhibited in the United States, [199]Canada
   and [200]Europe. He was honored by the Professional Rodeo Cowboy
   Artists Association as the first rodeo cowboy to become a professional
   cowboy artist and sculptor. He was the first cowboy artist to be
   honored as a Fellow of the [201]Royal Society of Arts of [202]London.
   In the summer of 2005, the Earl W. Bascom Memorial Rodeo was held in
   [203]Berlin, [204]Germany where his cowboy art was exhibited as an
   honor by the European Rodeo Cowboys Association for Bascom's worldwide
   influence upon the sport of rodeo.

[[205]edit] Later years

   Always one who had deep thoughts and religious leanings, Earl Bascom
   was ordained a [206]Latter-day Saint [207]Bishop and [208]Patriarch
   later in life. As the late cowboy celebrity [209]Roy Rogers, who worked
   with Earl Bascom in TV commercials and was a collector of Bascom art,
   once said, “Earl Bascom is a walking book of history. His knowledge of
   the Old West was acquired the old fashioned way – he was born and
   raised in it.”^[210][19]

   Bascom died at the age of 89 on his ranch in [211]Victorville,
   California, August 28, 1995.
