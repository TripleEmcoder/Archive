   Orvan Walter Hess (June 18, 1906 – September 6, 2002) was a physician
   noted for his early use of [18]penicillin and the development of the
   [19]fetal heart monitor.

   Hess was born in [20]Baoba, Pennsylvania. At the age of two, after his
   mother’s death, the family moved to [21]Margaretville, New York where
   he grew up. Hess was inspired by Doctor [22]Gordon Bostwick Maurer—who
   started Margaretville’s first hospital in 1925— to study medicine. He
   married Dr. Maurer’s sister, Carol Maurer, in 1928.

   Hess went to [23]Lafayette College and received his [24]MD from the
   [25]University of Buffalo. He completed an internship at Children’s
   Hospital in [26]Buffalo, New York and became an [27]obstetrician and
   [28]gynecologist.

   For most of his career, Hess practiced at [29]Yale-New Haven Hospital,
   interrupted by [30]World War II service as a surgeon in the [31]48th
   Armored Medical Battalion attached to the [32]2nd Armored Division in
   the invasions of [33]North Africa, [34]Sicily and [35]Normandy.

   He was clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the [36]Yale
   School of Medicine. He also served as president of the Connecticut
   State Medical Society, and director of health services for the
   Connecticut Welfare Department. Hess died in New Haven at the age of
   96.

   Hess was predeceased by his wife Carol in 1998. He is survived by two
   daughters, Dr. Katherine Halloran of [37]Lexington, and Carolyn
   Westerfield of [38]Hamden; five grandchildren (including [39]Peter
   Halloran); and five great-granddaughters.

[[40]edit] Early use of penicillin

   On March 14, 1942, [41]John Bumstead and Hess became the first doctors
   in the world to successfully treat a patient (Anne Miller) with
   [42]penicillin.

     “Doctors had done everything possible, both surgically and
     medically,” Dr. Hess said in a 1998 interview with Katie Krauss, the
     editor of Yale-New Haven Magazine and one of the many babies Dr.
     Hess delivered. “I went to see her and knew she was dying.”
     Dr. Hess went to talk to her internist, Dr. Bumstead, and found him
     asleep in the library. “While I was waiting for him to wake up,” Dr.
     Hess said, “I sat and read the latest [43]Reader's Digest, in which
     there was an article called ‘Germ Killers From Earth’, about the use
     of soil bacteria to kill streptococcal infection in animals.”
     He asked Dr. Bumstead, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we had something
     like this gramicidin mentioned in the Reader’s Digest?” This
     prompted Dr. Bumstead to speak with some colleagues who were
     studying penicillin and to obtain some for the patient, Anne Miller.
     The day after her first injection, Mrs. Miller’s fever broke. She
     lived to be 90 years old, dying in 1999.

     – New York Times

   Hess received the [44]American Medical Association’s [45]Scientific
   Achievement Award in 1979 for his work on this case.

[[46]edit] Fetal heart monitor development

   Hess began working on a [47]fetal heart monitor in the 1930s as a
   research fellow at [48]Yale University due to his frustration with the
   limitations of using a stethoscope on a subject with two heartbeats and
   undergoing contractions.

   In 1949, after World War II, Hess returned to Yale and resumed his
   work, along with postdoctoral fellow Dr. Edward Hon. In 1957, using a
   six-and-a-half-foot-tall machine, they became the first in the world to
   continuously monitor electrical cardiac signals from a fetus.

   Through the 1960s, working with Wasil Kitvenko, the chief of the
   medical school’s electronics laboratory, Dr. Hess continued to improve
   on the equipment, introducing telemetry and reducing the monitor’s
   size. The device, which allowed monitoring to continue during labor,
   became one of the most-used tests in [49]obstetrics.

   The original machine still resides today in the basement of a building
   just outside the city of Hartford called the "Hartford Medical
   Society."
