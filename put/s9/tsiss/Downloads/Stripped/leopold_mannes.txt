   Leopold Damrosch Mannes (December 26, 1899 – August 11, 1964) was a
   [14]Jewish-[15]American musician, born in [16]New York City, who,
   together with [17]Leopold Godowsky, Jr., created the first practical
   [18]color transparency film, [19]Kodachrome.

   Leopold Mannes was son of [20]David Mannes and [21]Clara Damrosch.
   Mannes and Godowsky's experimentation with color photography began in
   1917, after seeing the film [22]Our Navy in [23]Prizma Color, which was
   advertised as a color film. Because of the low quality the boys felt
   cheated and decided to do something about it. They designed a [24]movie
   camera and [25]projector, each with three [26]lenses covered by
   orange-red, green and blue-violet [27]filters^[28][1]. They took
   multiple [29]black-and-white exposures and projected them back through
   the filters. They patented this system, but it was not a commercially
   viable process.

   Mannes went on to study piano at [30]Harvard and earned a [31]Pulitzer
   Music Scholarship and a [32]Guggenheim fellowship (1926) to study music
   composition in Italy. He later continued to play professional piano
   while studying physics at Harvard. Godowsky studied violin at [33]UCLA
   and became a violinist with the [34]Los Angeles and the [35]San
   Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Although a continent apart, they
   continued to collaborate on ideas for improving color photography. By
   1922, Godowsky had given up his orchestra jobs in California and moved
   back to New York City where he and Mannes worked as musicians. They
   experimented with color photography during their spare time.

   While on his way to perform in Europe in late 1922, Mannes made the
   chance acquaintance of a senior partner in the investment firm of
   [36]Kuhn, Loeb and Co. and described their progress with color
   photography. Some months later the firm sent one of their junior
   associates, [37]Lewis L. Strauss to the Mannes apartment to view the
   color process. The final results were impressive enough for Kuhn Loeb
   to invest in the process.

   With financial backing, Mannes and Godowsky built a dedicated
   laboratory and in 1924 took out additional patents on their work. In
   1930 [38]Eastman Kodak was so impressed with their results that they
   contracted them to move to Rochester and take advantage of Kodak's
   research facilities.

   By 1935, Mannes and Godowsky and the Kodak research staff had developed
   a marketable [39]subtractive color film for home movies. [40]Kodachrome
   film was coated with three layers of ordinary [41]black-and-white
   [42]silver halide [43]gelatin [44]emulsion, but each layer was made
   sensitive to only one-third of the [45]spectrum of colors -- in
   essence, to red, green or blue. Special processing chemistry and
   procedures caused [46]complimentary-colored cyan, magenta or yellow
   [47]dye images to be generated in these layers as the black-and-white
   silver images were developed. After they had served their purpose, the
   silver images were chemically removed, so that the completed
   [48]chromogenic film consisted solely of the three layers of dye images
   suspended in [49]gelatin.

   [50]Kodachrome [51]16mm movie film was released for sale in 1935, and
   in 1936 Kodachrome [52]35mm still and [53]8mm movie film were released.

   Mannes returned to music after inventing Kodachrome, performing as a
   pianist and composing several musical scores. He served as president of
   the [54]Mannes College of Music (founded by his parents in New York)
   and served as a judge in music competitions, including the first
   [55]Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.

   Leopold Godowsky, Jr. married George Gershwin's younger sister, the
   singer [56]Frances Gershwin, who went on to become a painter and
   sculptor. He continued the musical tradition of his father, [57]Leopold
   Godowsky (who was a well known pianist in his time), playing violin
   with the Los Angeles and San Francisco Symphony Orchestras, as well as
   performing jointly with his father.

   Mannes and Godowsky were inducted into the [58]National Inventors Hall
   of Fame in 2005.

       1927) page 1, lines 25-29 specifies this variant of the standard
       red, green and blue filter colors, which was also used by the
       then-current Autochrome process. However, the patent is mainly
       concerned with a two-color (red-orange and blue-green)
       implementation.
