   John Ruggles (October 8, 1789 – June 20, 1874) was an [16]American
   politician from the [17]U.S. state of [18]Maine. He served in several
   important state legislative and judicial positions before serving in
   the [19]U.S. Senate.

   Ruggles was born in [20]Westborough, [21]Massachusetts. He attended
   public school there and in 1813 graduated from [22]Brown University in
   [23]Providence, [24]Rhode Island. Ruggles studied law, and after being
   admitted to the bar in 1815 he began practicing in [25]Skowhegan,
   [26]Maine. Two years later, Ruggles moved to [27]Thomaston. In 1823,
   Ruggles was elected to the [28]Maine House of Representatives. He
   served in the House until 1831, and was [29]speaker (1825–1829 and
   again in 1831). He resigned from the state house to replace [30]Samuel
   E. Smith (who had been elected [31]governor) as a justice of the
   supreme judicial court of Maine, serving until 1834.

   The state legislature elected Ruggles as a [32]Democratic-Republican
   ([33]Jacksonian) to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the
   resignation of [34]Peleg Sprague. He was later elected for the full
   term beginning March 4, 1835, and in total served from January 20,
   1835, to March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection
   in 1840.

   During his tenure in [35]Congress, Ruggles had served as chairman of
   the Committee on Patents and Patent Office ([36]25th Congress), and in
   1836 framed the bill for the reorganization of the [37]United States
   Patent Office. He was known for his interest in [38]inventions and
   [39]patents, and because of his legislative accomplishments in this
   area he has become known as the "Father of the U.S. Patent Office".
   Ruggles also was an inventor and the patent-holder of [40]U.S. Patent
   1, issued July 13, 1836. His invention was a type of train wheel
   designed to reduce the adverse effects of the weather on the track.
   Note that this was not the first patent ever from the USPTO; the
   previous patents were destroyed by fire and afterwards called the
   [41]X-Patents, and new patents afterwards were numbered from 1 again.
   Ruggles received the first patent granted under the new system;
   [42]Samuel Hopkins received the first X-Patent.

   In retirement, Ruggles resumed the practice of law in [43]Thomaston.
   There he made several more inventions and was well-known as a political
   writer and orator. Ruggles was wealthy; he and his wife Margaret George
   Ruggles had children and lived in the largest house on the town's Main
   Street. He died in 1874 a few months before reaching age 85. He is
   interred in the Elm Grove Cemetery.
