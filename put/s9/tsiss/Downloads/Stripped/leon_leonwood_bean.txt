[[23]edit] History

   Bean was born in the town of [24]Greenwood, [25]Maine^[26][1] on
   November 13, 1872 to Benjamin Warren Bean and Sarah (Swett)
   Bean.^[27][2] He had five brothers. Bean's interest in business was
   shown early, with his first money earned when he was nine years old. He
   was told he could attend the local fair or sell steel traps to his
   father, and Bean decided to sell the traps.^[28][2] When Bean was 12
   years of age, his parents died only four days apart from each other. He
   moved to [29]South Paris, Maine to stay with family. When Bean was 13
   years old, he killed and sold his first deer. His education was
   limited. Bean's schooling outside of public school include only one
   semester at [30]Hebron Academy, and a course in business at [31]Kent's
   Hill Academy. Bean paid for the limited amount of schooling he
   completed by himself.^[32][3]

[[33]edit] Foundation of L.L.Bean

   Bean was an avid [34]hunter and [35]fisherman. In his outdoor
   activities he noticed that his [36]boots would become soaked with
   [37]water. Bean set out to resolve this inconvenience, and developed
   plans for a waterproof boot. The boot was a combination of lightweight
   leather for the upper part of the boot and rubber on the bottom^[38][2]
   He brought the plans to a cobbler, and the first boots were made. Bean
   felt the boot produced to be of good quality, and obtained a list of
   non-resident [39]Maine [40]hunting license holders and prepared a
   descriptive [41]mail order circular. He promised 100% money back for
   anyone who was unhappy with the boots. Because of this, Bean had to
   refund 90% of the costs of the first 100 sets of boots made, when the
   rubber on the bottom developed cracks^[42][2] Bean seemed not to mind
   returning the money, and the popularity of the boots was clear. In
   1911, Bean took out a loan in the amount of [43]$400 and set off to
   [44]Boston. In Boston, he offered the [45]United States Rubber Company
   the remainder of his [46]$400 to produce a better quality of boot for
   him. With the better quality boots available, Bean set up a boot shop
   in his brother's [47]basement in [48]Freeport, Maine. His skills and
   trials as an entrepreneur, along with his promise to return 100% money
   back on all items, were detailed by many local and national newspapers
   of the time. By 1917, he had sold enough of his boots to buy a
   dedicated building for his shop on the main street of Freeport. In
   1918, Bean realised the importance of [49]patenting his invention. As
   the patent was granted, he moved on to inventing and improving more
   [50]outdoor equipment and expanding his store to what [51]L.L.Bean is
   today.^[52][2]

[[53]edit] As an author

   Bean published a book in 1942, called Hunting, Fishing and Camping and
   an autobiography, in 1960, called My Story: the Autobiography of a
   Down-East Merchant."^[54][4]^[55][5]

[[56]edit] Death and legacy

   Bean died in [57]Pompano Beach, [58]Florida, on February 5, 1967, at
   the age of 94. He was [59]buried in Freeport's [60]Webster
   Cemetery.^[61][6] At the time of his death, the annual sales of his
   company were in the hundreds of millions. Company policy of giving 100%
   money back on returned products still applies today.^[62][3]^[63][7]

   [64]Maine Medical Center has named one of its wings in his
   honor.^[65][8] In addition, his portrait hangs in a ground-floor
   corridor at the hospital. Not to be confused with the first floor,
   which is one floor up from the ground level.
