               James Joseph Brown
   "J.J." Brown in 1908.
   Born September 27, 1854(1854-09-27)
        [13]Waymart, [14]Pennsylvania, [15]U.S.
   Died September 5, 1922(1922-09-05) (aged 67)
        [16]Nassau, [17]New York, [18]U.S.

   James Joseph "J.J." Brown (September 27, 1854 – September 5, 1922),
   mining engineer, inventor, and self-made member of fashionable
   "society", was born in [19]Waymart, Pennsylvania. His wife was [20]RMS
   Titanic survivor [21]Molly Brown.

   J.J's father, James Brown, was an Irish immigrant. His mother, Cecilia
   Palmer, was a schoolteacher. J.J's family moved to [22]Pittston,
   Pennsylvania shortly after his birth. J.J's mother home-schooled him
   and later sent him to St. John's Academy. He left home at the age of 23
   lured by the riches in the West. His first stop was a farm in
   [23]Nebraska. From Nebraska he moved to the placer mines in the
   Dakotas. He spent two years learning the mining trade before moving to
   Colorado where he tried his luck in Georgetown, Aspen, and Ashcroft. He
   spent another two years in the Aspen and Ashcroft area before moving to
   Alma, Fairplay, Red Cliff, and, finally, Leadville. He studied geology,
   ore deposits and mining techniques to become a better miner.

[[29]edit] Marriage

   J.J. married [30]Margaret "Maggie" Tobin Brown on September 1, 1886.
   Maggie was later known as The Unsinkable Molly Brown when a Broadway
   fictionalized movie about her life titled, The Unsinkable Molly Brown
   was released in 1964. That was how Maggie's moniker Molly was acquired.
   Maggie Brown was one of the survivors of the [31]RMS Titanic sinking in
   1912. At the time of their marriage, J.J. was 31 and Maggie was 19.
   They first settled in [32]Leadville, Colorado in a small, two-room log
   cabin. The Browns had two children. Their first child Lawrence Palmer
   Brown was born on August 30, 1887 in Hannibal, Missouri. Their second
   child, Catherine Ellen Brown, nicknamed Helen, was born on July 1, 1889
   in Leadville, Colorado.

[[33]edit] Separation

   In 1909, after 23 years of marriage, J.J. and Molly signed a separation
   agreement and went their separate ways. The agreement gave Margaret a
   cash settlement and maintained possession of the house on Pennsylvania
   Street in Denver. She also received $700 a month allowance to continue
   her travels and philanthropic activities. Although they never
   reconciled, they remained connected and cared for each other throughout
   their lives. At the time of J.J.'s death in 1922, Margaret told
   newspapers, "I've never met a finer, bigger, more worthwhile man than
   J.J. Brown."'

[[34]edit] Career

   Although J.J. was not rich, he was ambitious, smart and charismatic. He
   quickly rose through the mining ranks to shift-boss and timberman. He
   was foreman of the Louisville Mine by the time he and Maggie met. By
   1887 he was superintendent of the Louisville Mine, and in 1888 he was
   superintendent of the Henriette & Maid Consolidated Mining Company, at
   the time one of the most productive mines in the area.

   The Brown family came into great wealth when J.J's engineering efforts
   proved instrumental in the production of a substantial gold and copper
   seam at the Little Jonny mine of his employers, Ibex Mining Company.

[[35]edit] Little Jonny mine

   J.J. who was the superintendent of all the Ibex properties, devised a
   method of using baled hay and timbers to stop the cave-ins. His
   invention paid off. When the Little Jonny mine opened, vast quantities
   of high-grade copper and gold were found. The grade of gold was so pure
   and the vein so wide that it was heralded as the then world's richest
   gold strike. By October 29, 1893, the Little Jonny was shipping 135
   tons^[[36]citation needed] of gold ore per day. J.J. was awarded 12,500
   shares or 12.5% of stock and a seat on the board. The Ibex Company and
   its owners, including the Browns became extraordinarily wealthy. In
   1894, the Browns moved to [37]Denver buying a $30,000 mansion in
   Denver's wealthy Capitol Hill neighborhood.

[[38]edit] Death

   On September 5, 1922 J.J. died after suffering a series of [39]heart
   attacks at a hospital in [40]Nassau, New York with his daughter, Helen
   (Mrs. George Benziger) by his side. Unfortunately, J.J. died without a
   will and it took 5 years of fighting between Maggie and her two
   children to finally settle the estate. Due to their lavish spending
   J.J. left an estate valued at only $238,000. Maggie was to receive
   $20,000 in cash and securities, and the interest on a $100,000 trust
   fund set up in her name. Her children, Lawrence and Helen received the
   rest. From that time through her death in 1932, Maggie had no contact
   with her children.
