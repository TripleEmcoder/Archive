   Ambrose Swasey
      Born     December 19, 1846
               [14]Exeter, New Hampshire
      Died     June 15, 1937
               [15]Exeter, New Hampshire
   Nationality United States
   Occupation  Machinist, inventor, manager, entrepreneur
    Known for  Co-founder of the [16]Warner & Swasey Company

   Ambrose Swasey (December 19, 1846–June 15, 1937) was an [17]American
   mechanical engineer, inventor, entrepreneur, manager, astronomer, and
   philanthropist. With [18]Worcester R. Warner he co-founded the
   [19]Warner & Swasey Company.

   Swasey was born near [20]Exeter, New Hampshire.^[21][1] He apprenticed
   as a machinist at the Exeter Machine Works and was afterwards employed
   at [22]Pratt & Whitney.^[23][1] As his career progressed he became a
   foreman in the gear-cutting section. He developed a new technique for
   making gear-tooth cutters.^[24][1] In 1880 he and Warner formed their
   eponymous firm,^[25][2] which quickly moved to [26]Cleveland, Ohio.
   Swasey would perform the engineering and machine development at this
   company.

   The close friends Warner and Swasey built their homes next to each
   other on [27]Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, a street that was known as
   "Millionaire's Row".

   In addition to army ordinance contracts, the firm of Warner & Swasey
   became notable for their work on astronomical observatories and
   equipment. They realized that obtaining contracts to build large
   astronomical observatories would provide publicity for their company.

   In 1885 Swasey completed work at [28]McCormick Observatory on the
   45-foot [29]dome, which was the largest in the world, and had a unique,
   3 shutter design. In 1887 Swasey built the mount for the 36-inch
   [30]refracting telescope at [31]Lick Observatory. In 1898 he
   manufactured a [32]dividing engine for the [33]U.S. Naval Observatory
   that was used to make the meridian circles. Both the building and dome
   of the [34]Dominion Astrophysical Observatory were made by Warner and
   Swasey Co. Other observatory telescopes and components were built by
   the company at the Kenwood Observatory, [35]Yerkes Observatory,
   Argentia National Observatory, and the Case Institute Observatory.

   From 1904^[36][1] until 1905 he was the president of the [37]American
   Society of Mechanical Engineers.

   Both Warner and Swasey were amateur astronomers. In 1920 they made a
   joint donation to the [38]Case Western Reserve University to fund the
   construction of an observatory. This was named the [39]Warner and
   Swasey Observatory in their honor, and the observatory was used for
   research by the Case astronomy department. The observatory maintained
   by the department today is still known by this name today.

   Other donations made by Swasey include the Swasey Chapel in
   [40]Cleveland (1924), a bandstand in Exeter by architect [41]Henry
   Bacon, (1916), and the endowment of a chair for a professor of physics
   at the Case School of Applied Sciences. The chimes in the chapel were
   included as a memorial to his wife, Lavinia Marston Swasey.

   He died in Exeter. The Warner & Swasey Company he cofounded would
   continue until 1980, when it was acquired by [42]Bendix Corporation.

[[43]edit] Awards and honors

     * The crater [44]Swasey on the [45]Moon is named after him, as is the
       [46]asteroid [47]992 Swasey.
     * At CWRU, the chair of "Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics" was
       named for his endowment. ([48]Lawrence M. Krauss was named to this
       position in 1993.)
     * In 1932 he was awarded the [49]Franklin Medal.
     * In 1936 he was awarded the [50]Hoover Medal.
     * Swasey was a member of the [51]United States National Research
       Council.^[52][3]
