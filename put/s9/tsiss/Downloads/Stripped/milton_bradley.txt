                  Milton Bradley
      Born    November 8, 1836(1836-11-08)
              [8]Vienna, Maine, U.S.
      Died    May 30, 1911(1911-05-30) (aged 74)
              [9]Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.
   Occupation Board game manufacturer

   Milton Bradley (November 8, 1836 – May 30, 1911), an [10]American game
   pioneer, was credited by many with launching the [11]board game
   industry in North America with [12]Milton Bradley Company.

   A native of [13]Vienna, Maine, in his late teens Bradley chose to
   pursue the printing trade, including [14]lithography. He set up the
   first color lithography shop in the commonwealth of [15]Massachusetts,
   established in Springfield in 1860. Eventually, Bradley moved forward
   with an idea he had for a board game which he called The Checkered Game
   of Life, an early version of what would later become [16]The Game of
   Life.

   In 2004, he was posthumously inducted into the [17]National Toy Hall of
   Fame along with George Ditomassi of Milton Bradley Co. Through the 20th
   century the company he founded in 1860, [18]Milton Bradley Company
   dominated the production of American games, with titles like
   [19]Candyland, [20]Operation, and [21]Battleship. The company is now a
   subsidiary of [22]Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based [23]Hasbro.

[[32]edit] Early years

   Born in [33]Vienna, Maine, to craftsman Lewis Bradley and Fannie Lyford
   on November 8, 1836, Milton Bradley attended high school in the
   industrial mill town of [34]Lowell, Massachusetts. Upon completing his
   secondary education, Bradley pursued technical training as a draftsman
   at the Lawrence Scientific School, but could not obtain sufficient
   funding to complete the two-year course. After a two-year spell in
   [35]Hartford, Connecticut with his parents, Bradley returned to
   Massachusetts, settling in [36]Springfield, Massachusetts in 1856.
   Beginning an association with technological and intellectual innovation
   that would recur throughout his life, Milton Bradley then began work
   with the Wason Car-Manufacturing Company, drafting plans for railroad
   cars. After briefly leaving Wason to pursue independent drafting for
   patent seekers, Bradley rejoined the company and remained until 1860.

   Unsatisfied with his profession, Bradley taught himself lithography and
   print-making, producing an image of Abraham Lincoln during the 1860
   presidential campaign that sold well in the heavily Republican
   Massachusetts. Lincoln’s decision to grow a beard, and the resulting
   iconic connection of facial hair to the sixteenth president,
   immediately rendered Bradley’s lithograph obsolete, and left his
   fledgling printing business without a marketable image.

[[37]edit] The Checkered Game of Life: The launch of the [38]Milton Bradley
Company

   1872 advertisement

   In search of a lucrative alternative project in which to employ his
   drafting skills, Bradley found inspiration from an imported board game
   given to him by a friend. Concluding that he could produce and market a
   similar game to American consumers, Milton Bradley released [39]The
   Checkered Game of Life in the winter of 1860.

   The game proved an instant success with the public. Bradley personally
   sold his first run of several hundred copies in one two-day period in
   New York; by 1861, consumers had bought over 45,000 copies. The
   Checkered Game of Life followed a structure similar to its American and
   British predecessors, with players spinning a [40]teetotum to advance
   to corresponding squares. The squares each represented a social virtue
   or vice, with the former earning a player points and the latter
   retarding his progress. The player who first accumulated one hundred
   points won the game.
   The original game board of The Checkered Game of Life.

   While the structure of play used in The Checkered Game of Life differed
   little from previous board games, Bradley’s game embraced a radically
   different concept of success. Earlier children’s games, such as the
   popular [41]Mansion of Happiness developed in Puritan Massachusetts,
   were concerned entirely with providing an attractive venue from which
   to promote moral virtue. But Bradley preferred to define success in
   secular business terms consistent with America’s emerging focus on “the
   causal relationship between character and wealth.” This approach, which
   depicted life as a quest for accomplishment in which personal virtues
   provided a means to an end, rather than a point of focus, complemented
   America’s burgeoning fascination with obtaining wealth in the years
   following the Civil War.

[[42]edit] Final years

   Though The Checkered Game of Life and its several successive variations
   accounted for Bradley's financial success, board games did not
   constitute his primary focus in life. Once his pecuniary future had
   been secured, Bradley turned his attention to a series of progressive
   scientific and educational causes. Having met Edward Wiebe, an early
   American proponent of the kindergarten movement, in 1869, Bradley began
   to explore the ideas of the German romantic philosopher [43]Friedrich
   Wilhelm August Fröbel. Fröbel challenged prevalent notions for
   educating children, which emphasized recitation, rote memorization, and
   the teaching of factual information from a child’s earliest schooling.
   Believing that these practices-–which attempted to instill an adult
   mentality in children-–ran contrary to both effective teaching and a
   child’s natural impulses, Fröbel suggested a pattern of education that
   focused on the child’s vantage point. Fröbel's theory stressed
   stimulation of aesthetic and sensory perception, kept lessons brief,
   presented them in simple terms suitable for a child’s consumption, and
   incorporated instinctual preferences for play and spontaneity. Froebel
   also used "gifts," which were objects to handle, later building blocks
   and dramatic play. He also used occupations which were materials
   tolearn skills, later arts and crafts and also circles which included
   mother songs and finger plays. A year after Bradley met Wiebe, the
   Milton Bradley Company published Wiebe’s book “The Paradise of
   Childhood: A Manual for Self-Instruction in Freidrich Froebel’s
   Educational Principles, and a Practical Guide to Kinder-Gartners,”
   which describes a list of 20 Froebel gifts.

   Enthralled with Fröbel's ideas, Bradley made distinct contributions to
   bringing them to prominence with the American public. Beginning in
   1869, he published educational tracts and pamphlets on the virtues of
   Fröbel's kindergarten system. His company produced two magazines on the
   subject, Kindergarten News (later Kindergarten Review), and Work and
   Play. Though neither produced a profit, compelling Bradley’s business
   partners to withdraw their support, Bradley persevered, publishing the
   magazines until the end of his life. Bradley's lifelong friend, George
   Tapley, bought out his business partner's shares so Bradley could
   continue manufacturing his educational materials. By the 1890s, the
   Milton Bradley Company had introduced the first watercolour sets with
   standardized colours and education games such as Bradley's Word Builder
   and Bradley's Sentence Builder. The Milton Bradley Company was also the
   first to release crayon packages with standardized colors, forerunning
   the better-known [44]Crayola Crayons and Artista Art Supplies of the
   Binney & Smith Company.

   Bradley married twice in his lifetime, first to Villona Eaton in 1860.
   They had no children together. He then married again to Ellen Thayer in
   1869. Bradley and Ms. Thayer had two daughters together: Alice L.
   Bradley, born c. 1881, and Florence L. Bradley, born c. 1875. He died
   on May 30, 1911 in Springfield.
