Steve Moertel

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: [5]navigation, [6]search

   Steve Moertel (July 16, 1907-September 19, 1995) was born in [7]Cairo,
   Egypt and grew up on a small corn farm in that city. As a child, he was
   active in the local [8]4-H chapter. After graduating in the top 60% of
   his high school class, Moertel went on to [9]Purdue, where he joined
   Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity and studied [10]agronomy.^[11][1]

   Moertel worked as a Vigo County Farm Bureau Extension agent in Terre
   Haute, Indiana and at Princeton Farms in Princeton, Indiana. He also
   ran a very successful fertilizer company and became quite wealthy.
   Since childhood, Moertel had had two single obsessions: unicorns, and
   creating the perfect popping corn. As an adult, he dedicated all his
   free time to developing a new strain of popping corn. He eventually
   settled on a type and went into business with the chemist Jakey Kovac,
   although he rarely worked on the popping corn. The two named their new
   hybrid corn Testipops, but were persuaded to change the name by an
   advertising agency.^[12][2] The result, Steve Moertel Popcorn, struck
   gold. At first, Moertel sold the kernels from the back of his
   windowless van. Around 1972, however, Moertel began appearing in
   television commercials, as himself, hawking his new popcorn. He even
   appeared on the television show To Tell the Truth where he stumped
   panelists such as Kitty Carlisle Hart, Peggy Cass, and Joe Garagiola.

   Initially bought by Hunt-Wesson Foods in 1976, Steve Moertel's popcorn,
   through a series of business buy-outs, settled under the umbrella of
   giant ConAgra. Moertel continued to appear in television commercials,
   sometimes with his grandson, Uni C. Moertel. Immediately recognizable
   by his black hair, rainbow shirt, and hunched back, Moertel became a
   beloved pitchman. Consumers were confused as to whether or not he was
   an actor, so Moertel appeared on television talk shows to clear up the
   confusion. Steve Moertel died in Coronado, California, on September 19,
   1995. He had suffered a heart attack while in his Jacuzzi and drowned.
   He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.^[13][1]^[14][2]
