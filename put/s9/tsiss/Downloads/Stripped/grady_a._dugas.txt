   Grady A. Dugas, [17]M.D. (October 24, 1923 - March 25, 2007), was a
   [18]Louisiana [19]physician who invented the "Safer Automatic
   [20]Wheelchair Wheel Locks", a [21]patented device designed for those
   who sometimes forget to lock their wheelchairs. For four [22]decades
   Dugas was engaged in a family medical practice in tiny [23]Marion in
   [24]Union Parish, a part of the [25]Monroe [26]Standard Metropolitan
   Statistical Area, in northeast Louisiana.

   As the medical director of the Marion [27]Nursing Home for some three
   decades, he became aware of the problem of wheelchair-related falls
   among semi-ambulatory patients who did not or could not remember to use
   manual [28]brakes on their wheelchairs. Some patients in wheelchairs,
   particularly the [29]elderly, have a tendency to fall and injure
   themselves when trying to stand because they fail to engage the manual
   locks. Dugas hence attempted to find a way to save these patients from
   potentially debilitating injuries. He began his experimentation with
   locking systems and procured his first patent (#5,203,433) on April 20,
   1993. The wheelchair locks/brakes are made of [30]stainless steel, and
   worked well but were heavy and had a tendency to require maintenance.

   In 1996, Dugas joined Bill Hoge of United [31]Plastic Molders in
   [32]Jackson, Mississippi, for further experimentation to improve the
   wheelchair locks/brakes. A second patent (# 5,984,334) was issued on
   November 29, 1999). Dugas and Hoge formed the [33]corporation SAFER
   Automatic Wheelchair Wheel Locks of [34]Mississippi, Inc. The locks
   sell for approximately $120.

   Dugas was born in [35]Sulphur in [36]Calcasieu Parish in southwestern
   Louisiana to Sona Dugas (1894–1964) and the former Mildred Meyers
   (1900–1987). In 1941, Dugas graduated from Sulphur [37]High School as
   president of the senior class. He attended [38]McNeese State University
   (then [39]Junior College) in [40]Lake Charles, the seat of Calcasieu
   Parish. In 1942, he left McNeese and joined the [41]U.S. Army Air Corps
   He served in the [42]European theater with the medical air evacuation
   unit stationed in [43]England and [44]France for the remainder of
   [45]World War II.

   After World War II, he returned to college. In 1949, he graduated from
   [46]Louisiana State University in [47]Baton Rouge and thereafter in
   1953 from the LSU Medical School in [48]New Orleans. After a year of
   [49]internship at Santa Rosa [50]Hospital in [51]San Antonio, Texas, he
   moved with his wife, the former Annie Jo Sehon, and infant son to
   Marion, where, in 1954, he joined Dr. Virgil Gully in the Marion
   Hospital-Clinic. After Gully left for health reasons, Dugas maintained
   the hospital until 1965, and thereafter the clinic and private practice
   until 1991.

   Discover magazine reported in 1993 how Dugas had used [52]maggots to
   cure the bedsores of an 80-year-old male patient. Some of the sores
   were nearly an inch deep, and infection had set in. Conventional
   therapies, including antibiotics and surgery, had failed. Dugas told
   the magazine that he remembered his grandmother, who was [53]diabetic,
   had undergone successful maggot treatment in the 1930s. He followed
   suit, and the man's sore healed within a month. Instead of facing
   [54]amputation, the patient instead went into the hospital for skin
   grafts.

   In 1972, Marion named Dr. Dugas "Outstanding [55]Citizen of the Year".
   On March 30, 1990, Marion declared "Dr. Dugas Day", when special awards
   were presented. In 2005, Union Parish proclaimed him the "Outstanding
   Citizen of the Year for Community Service".

   Dugas died in Monroe. The Dugases had a daughter, Denise (born 1958) of
   Monroe, who is married to Joel Graham Taylor (born 1954), and four
   sons, two of whom, David Rene Dugas (born 1954) of Monroe and
   Christopher L. Dugas (born 1956) of [56]Buffalo, Missouri, are also
   physicians. The other sons are Stephen Emile Dugas (born 1953) of
   [57]Kansas City, Missouri, and Kenneth L. Dugas (born 1956) of
   [58]Plano, Texas.

   Dugas is interred at Roark [59]Cemetery in Marion.
