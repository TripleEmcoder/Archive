[[43]edit] History

   The Just Born candy tradition was conceived in 1910, when [44]Russian
   [45]immigrant [46]Sam Born came to the [47]United States. In 1916, Sam
   Born was awarded the "[48]key to the city" of San Francisco for
   inventing a machine that mechanically inserted sticks into
   [49]lollipops.

   In 1917, Born opened a small retail store in [50]Brooklyn, [51]New
   York. He proudly displayed in his store window an evolving line of
   daily made candy, marketing its freshness with a sign that declared
   Just Born. The original company logo showed a baby resting in a candy
   measuring scale. Some of Sam Born's contributions to the candy industry
   include chocolate sprinkles, known as "[52]jimmies," and the hard
   coating on ice cream bars.

   In 1923, Born started his own manufacturing company in [53]New York
   City. Irv and Jack Schaffer, Born's brothers in law, joined the company
   to help market and sell the confections. In 1932, the trio moved
   operations to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

   Sam Born's son, Bob Born who joined the company in 1946 and would later
   become President for more than 30 years, was part of the two man team
   that mechanized the marshmallow Peeps forming process. It was this
   ingenuity that enabled them to dramatically increase production and led
   them to become America's largest manufacturer of seasonal marshmallow
   confections.

[[54]edit] Prize trip to Fargo

   In December 2010, the company's sales team won second prize, an
   all-expenses-paid trip to [55]Fargo, North Dakota, when they posted a
   2% annual sales gain rather than the targeted 4%, missing out on the
   first prize, a trip to [56]Hawaii. The 19-person team toured North
   Dakota wineries, went sleigh-riding and tobogganing, and enjoyed a $5
   spaghetti dinner at the West Fargo VFW.^[57][1]

[[58]edit] Just Born today

   Just Born continues to be family owned. Currently the co-CEOs are Mr.
   Born's grandson Ross Born and nephew David Shaffer. Samuel Torrence was
   the first non-family president in the history of the company.

   The first Just Born retail store opened in fall 2009 at [59]National
   Harbor, Maryland.

   Just Born is a noted contributor to the Bethlehem community and makes
   many charitable contributions.
