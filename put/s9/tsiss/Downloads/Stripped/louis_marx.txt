   Louis Marx (August 11, 1896–February 5, 1982) was an [10]American toy
   maker and businessman whose company, [11]Louis Marx and Company was the
   largest toy company in the world in the 1950s. Marx was described as an
   intense, hard-driving, and energetic man, who "[T]alks, walks, and
   gestures tirelessly, like one of his own wound-up toys."^[[12]citation
   needed]

   Marx was known by numerous nicknames, including "Toycoon," "the
   [13]Henry Ford of the toy industry," "the hawk of the toy industry,"
   and "the toy king of America."^[[14]citation needed]

[[15]edit] Biography

   Born in [16]Brooklyn, New York to [17]Jewish [18]German parents, Marx
   graduated high school at age 15 and started his career working for
   [19]Ferdinand Strauss, a manufacturer of mechanical toys. By 1916, Marx
   was managing Strauss' [20]East Rutherford, New Jersey plant. But within
   a year, Marx was fired by Strauss' board of directors over a
   disagreement about sales practices.

   Marx then entered the [21]United States Army as a private and attained
   the rank of sergeant before returning to civilian life in 1918. Marx's
   passion for the Army was reflected throughout his life; most of Marx's
   military toys represented Army equipment, and Marx would make a
   practice of befriending generals and naming his sons after them.

   Following military service, Marx then went to work selling for a
   Vermont based manufacturer of [22]wood toys, redesigned the product
   line, and increased the company's sales tenfold.^[23][1]

   In 1919 Marx and his brother David incorporated, founding the company
   that bore his name. Initially working as a middle man, Marx was soon
   able to purchase tooling to manufacture toys himself. When Strauss fell
   on hard financial times, Marx was able to buy the dies for two Strauss
   toys and turn them into best-sellers. By age 26, three years after
   founding his company, Marx was a millionaire.

   By utilizing techniques of [24]mass production and reusing old designs
   as much as possible - Marx utilized some of his [25]toy train tooling
   developed in the early 1930s until 1972 - Marx was able to sell a broad
   line of inexpensive toys. All US made toy trains would come from the
   Girard plant, producing millions of lithographed tin and plastic toy
   trains.^[26][2]

   By 1951, Marx's company had 12 factories worldwide and for much of the
   1950s it was the largest toy manufacturer in the world adding most of
   the success to [27]Sears, Roebuck catalog sales and the many themed
   playsets available. As [28]World War II drew to a close, Marx had
   toured [29]Europe and acted as a consultant on how toy manufacturing
   could aid reconstruction efforts. Marx used the contacts he made in
   this manner to forge partnerships and open factories in Europe and
   [30]Japan. Marx was featured on the cover of the December 12, 1955
   issue of [31]Time Magazine, his likeness surrounded by examples of his
   toys.

   Marx's first wife, Renee, died of [32]breast cancer at age 33. His
   second wife, a secretary at his company, was 28 years his junior.
   The mausoleum of Louis Marx in [33]Woodlawn Cemetery

   Marx's daughter, Patricia, was born in 1938. She went on to become an
   author and activist and married [34]Daniel Ellsberg, of [35]Pentagon
   Papers fame. Marx, who had been a strident anti-[36]Communist and was
   an admirer of [37]Richard Nixon, regarded Ellsberg as a
   traitor.^[[38]citation needed]

   Marx's son, Louis Marx Junior, is a [39]venture capitalist. He seems to
   be a [40]philanthropist who has contributed to the arts, education and
   medicine. One such example is the Louis Marx Center for Children and
   Families of New York.

   Marx retired in 1972, selling his company to [41]Quaker Oats for $54
   million. Marx was 76 years old and his company had been declining. The
   decline has variously been blamed on the company's slowness to develop
   electronic toys and on Marx's unwillingness to employ salesmen for fear
   of someone else repeating his early experience with Strauss.

   Louis Marx died in a hospital in [42]White Plains, New York at age 85.
   He is interred in a private mausoleum in [43]Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx,
   [44]New York.

   The original house of the Marx estate still stands on Gatehouse Road in
   Scarsdale, NY. Though empty and neglected, its grandeur is
   breathtaking. The red brick, white-pillared mansion was built in 1904
   and has nine fireplaces and 14 baths. It had a swimming pool, tennis
   court, paddle court and a four-car garage with a seven-room caretaker's
   cottage above it. A chain linkfence, to prevent Marx’s 13 dogs from
   straying, enclosed the entire compound. Before the subdivision of the
   property in the 1980s, the home had a Weaver Street address and could
   be viewed through the open lawn from the street. Now, surrounded by 29
   contemporary homes on uniform lots, the home is hidden from view and
   appears to be a vestige of a gone by era.

   The property was owned by the legendary Louis Marx, sometimes called
   the Toy King of America, who died in 1982 at the age of 85. He had nine
   children, who he named after famous friends who were named as
   godparents to the children: Emmett Dwight, for Gen. Emmett O'Donnell
   and President Eisenhower; Spencer Bedell, for Gen. Walter Bedell Smith;
   Bradley Marshall, for Gen. Omar N. Bradley and Gen. George C. Marshall;
   Curtis Gruenther, for Gen. Curtis E. LeMay and Gen. Albert M.
   Gruenther, and Hunter Bernhard, for Gen. Hunter Harris and Prince
   Bernhard of the Netherlands.

   Marx is as legendary as his estate. A 1955 article in Time Magazine
   describes his arrival at a soiree at the 21 Club in Manhattan; “A
   roly-poly, melon-bald little man with the berry-bright eyes and
   beneficent smile of St. Nick touching down on a familiar rooftop. Louis
   Marx, America's toy king and cafe-society Santa, was arriving at his
   favorite workshop. With his beautiful blonde wife Idella, who looks the
   way sleigh bells sound, 59-year-old Lou Marx toddled regally toward a
   table in the center of the downstairs room. The table is always
   reserved for Millionaire Marx by the divine right of toy kings, and the
   fact that he has never been known to let anyone else pay the check. “

   And city friends were not the only ones to benefit from his generosity.
   Each Halloween from 1940 to 1980, Marx distributed hundreds of toys to
   neighborhood children who came to trick or treat. He built a
   multi-million dollar toy company and was free handed with his gifts.

   Upon Marx’s death, Anthony Scarcella, a New Rochelle developer, bought
   the estate and received approval to subdivide it and build 29 homes. He
   built the development and in 1985 he sold the original home on
   1.75 acres (7,100 m^2) to Alexander Raydon, who kept it until October
   2007. When Raydon died, Scarcella re-purchased the house, for
   $2,500,000, which was more than the sale price of the entire estate in
   1982. Scarcella then attempted to gain approval to tear it down and
   build three more new homes on the property. However, this time he
   received far more resisitance from the Board of Architectural Review
   and ultimately the Scarsdale Board of Trustees. He was denied a
   demolition permit to tear down the home because it was found to be a
   structure of substantial historic importance. The BAR found that the
   mansion met three of the four preservation criteria and that its
   demolition would be detrimental to the public interest.
