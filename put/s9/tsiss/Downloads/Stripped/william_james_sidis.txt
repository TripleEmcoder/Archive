   Born April 1, 1898(1898-04-01)
   Died July 17, 1944(1944-07-17) (aged 46)

   William James Sidis (April 1, 1898 – July 17, 1944) was an [7]American
   [8]child prodigy with exceptional mathematical and linguistic
   abilities. He became famous first for his precocity, and later for his
   [9]eccentricity and withdrawal from the public eye. He avoided
   mathematics entirely in later life, writing on other subjects under a
   number of [10]pseudonyms.

[[24]edit] Biography

[[25]edit] Parents and upbringing (1898–1909)

   William James Sidis was born to Jewish Ukrainian [26]immigrants on
   April 1, 1898, in [27]New York City. His father [28]Boris Sidis, Ph.D.,
   M.D., had emigrated in 1887 to escape political persecution. His mother
   Sarah Mandelbaum Sidis, M.D., and her family had fled the [29]pogroms
   in 1889. Sarah attended [30]Boston University and graduated from its
   [31]School of Medicine in 1897.^[32][1] William was named after his
   godfather, Boris's friend and colleague, the American philosopher
   [33]William James. Boris earned his degrees at [34]Harvard University,
   and taught [35]psychology there. He was a [36]psychiatrist, and
   published numerous books and articles, performing pioneering work in
   [37]abnormal psychology. Boris was a [38]polyglot and his son William
   would become one too at a young age.

   Sidis's parents believed in nurturing a [39]precocious and fearless
   love of knowledge, for which they were criticized. Sidis could read the
   [40]New York Times at 18 months,^[41][2] had reportedly taught himself
   eight languages ([42]Latin, [43]Greek, [44]French, [45]Russian,
   [46]German, [47]Hebrew, [48]Turkish, and [49]Armenian) by age eight,
   and invented another, which he called [50]Vendergood.

[[51]edit] Harvard and college life (1909–1915)

   Although the University had previously refused to let his father enroll
   him at age nine because he was still a child, Sidis set a record in
   1909 by becoming the youngest person to enroll at [52]Harvard College.
   He was 11 years old, and entered Harvard as part of a program to enroll
   gifted students early. The experimental group included mathematician
   [53]Norbert Wiener, [54]Richard Buckminster Fuller, and composer
   [55]Roger Sessions^[[56]citation needed]. In early 1910, Sidis's
   mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard
   Mathematical Club on [57]four-dimensional bodies.^[58][3] [59]MIT
   professor [60]Daniel F. Comstock predicted that Sidis would become a
   great mathematician and a leader in that science in the future.^[61][4]
   Sidis began taking a full-time course load in 1910 and earned his
   [62]Bachelor of Arts degree, [63]cum laude, on June 18, 1914, at age
   16.^[64][5]

   Shortly after graduation, he told reporters that he wanted to live the
   perfect life, which to him meant living in [65]seclusion. He granted an
   interview to a reporter from the [66]Boston Herald. The paper reported
   Sidis's vows to remain [67]celibate and never to [68]marry, as he said
   women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for
   a young woman named Martha Foley.^[69][4] He later enrolled at
   Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

[[70]edit] Teaching and further education (1915–1919)

   After a group of Harvard students threatened Sidis physically, his
   parents secured him a job at the [71]William Marsh Rice Institute for
   the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art (now [72]Rice University)
   in [73]Houston, Texas as a mathematics teaching assistant. He arrived
   at Rice in December 1915 at the age of 17. He was a graduate fellow
   working toward his [74]doctorate.

   Sidis taught three classes: [75]Euclidean geometry, [76]non-Euclidean
   geometry, and [77]trigonometry (he wrote a textbook for the Euclidean
   geometry course in Greek). After less than a year, frustrated with the
   department, his teaching requirements, and his treatment by students
   older than him, Sidis left his post and returned to [78]New England.
   When a friend later asked him why he had left, he replied, "I never
   knew why they gave me the job in the first place—I'm not much of a
   [79]teacher. I didn't leave—I was asked to go." Sidis abandoned his
   pursuit of a graduate degree in mathematics and enrolled at the
   [80]Harvard Law School in September 1916, but withdrew in good standing
   in his final year in March 1919.^[81][6]

[[82]edit] Politics and arrest (1919–1921)

   In 1919, shortly after his withdrawal from law school, Sidis was
   arrested for participating in a [83]socialist [84]May Day parade in
   [85]Boston that turned violent. He was sentenced to 18 months in
   [86]prison under the [87]Sedition Act of 1918. Sidis's arrest featured
   prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had
   garnered considerable local celebrity. During the [88]trial, Sidis
   stated that he had been a [89]conscientious objector of the [90]World
   War I draft, an [91]atheist,^[92][7] and a [93]socialist.^[94][8] (He
   later developed his own philosophy of quasi-"[95]libertarianism" based
   on individual rights and "the American social
   continuity").^[96][9]^[97][10] His father arranged with the
   [98]district attorney to keep Sidis out of prison before his appeal
   came to trial; his parents, instead, held him in their [99]sanatorium
   in New Hampshire for a year. They took him to [100]California, where he
   spent another year.^[101][11] While at the sanatorium, his parents set
   about "reforming" him and threatened him with transfer to an
   [102]insane asylum.^[103][4]^[104][11]

[[105]edit] Later life (1921–1944)

   After returning to the [106]East Coast in 1921, Sidis was determined to
   live an independent and private life. He only took work running
   [107]adding machines or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in
   [108]New York City and became estranged from his parents. It took years
   before he was cleared legally to return to [109]Massachusetts, and he
   was concerned about his risk of arrest for years.^[110][4] He collected
   [111]streetcar transfers, published [112]periodicals, and taught small
   circles of interested friends his version of [113]American history.

   In 1944, Sidis won a settlement from [114]The New Yorker for an article
   published in 1937. He had alleged it contained many [115]false
   statements.^[116][12] Under the title "Where Are They Now?", the
   pseudonymous article described Sidis's life as lonely, in a "hall
   bedroom in Boston's shabby [117]South End".^[118][13] Lower courts had
   dismissed Sidis as a [119]public figure with no right to challenge
   personal publicity. He lost an appeal of an [120]invasion of privacy
   lawsuit at the [121]United States Court of Appeals for the Second
   Circuit in 1940 over the same article. Judge [122]Charles Edward Clark
   expressed sympathy for Sidis—who claimed that the publication had
   exposed him to "public scorn, ridicule, and contempt" and caused him
   "grievous mental anguish [and] humiliation"—but found that the court
   was not disposed to "afford to all the intimate details of private life
   an absolute immunity from the prying of the press".^[123][13]

   Sidis died in 1944 of a [124]cerebral hemorrhage in [125]Boston at the
   age of 46.^[126][14] His father had died of the same malady in 1923 at
   age 56.

[[127]edit] Publications and subjects of research

   From writings on [128]cosmology, to [129]American Indian history, to a
   comprehensive and definitive taxonomy of vehicle transfers, an equally
   comprehensive study of [130]civil engineering and vehicles, and several
   well-substantiated lost texts on [131]anthropology, [132]philology, and
   transportation systems, Sidis covered a broad range of subjects. Some
   of his ideas concerned [133]cosmological reversibility,^[134][15]
   "social continuity,"^[135][16] and individual rights in the United
   States.^[136][10]

   In The Animate and the Inanimate (1925), Sidis predicted the existence
   of regions of space where the [137]second law of thermodynamics
   operated in reverse to the temporal direction that we experience in our
   local area. Everything outside of what we would today call a
   [138]galaxy would be such a region. Sidis claimed that the matter in
   this region would not generate light. (These dark areas of the universe
   are not properly [139]dark matter or [140]black holes as they are used
   in contemporary cosmology.) This work on cosmology, based on his theory
   of reversibility of the second law of thermodynamics was the only book
   published under his name.^[141][15]

   Sidis's [142]The Tribes and the States (ca. 1935) employs the
   [143]pseudonym "John W. Shattuck," giving a 100,000-year history of
   North America's inhabitants, from [144]prehistoric times to
   1828.^[145][17] In this text, he suggests that "there were red men at
   one time in Europe as well as in America."^[146][18]

   Sidis was also a "[147]peridromophile," a term he coined for people
   fascinated with transportation research and [148]streetcar systems. He
   wrote a treatise on streetcar transfers under the pseudonym of "Frank
   Folupa" that identified means of increasing public transport
   usage.^[149][19]

   In 1930, Sidis was awarded a patent for a rotary [150]perpetual
   calendar that took into account leap years.^[151][20] In his adult
   years, it was estimated that he could speak more than forty languages,
   and learn a new language in a day.^[152][21]

[[153]edit] Vendergood language

   Sidis created a [154]constructed language called Vendergood in his
   second book, entitled Book of Vendergood, which he wrote at the age of
   eight. The language was mostly based on [155]Latin and [156]Greek, but
   also drew on [157]German and [158]French and other [159]Romance
   languages.^[160][22] It distinguished between eight different
   [161]conjugations: [162]indicative, [163]potential, [164]imperative
   absolute, [165]subjunctive, [166]imperative, [167]infinitive,
   [168]optative, and Sidis's own strongeable.^[[169]citation needed]
   Vendergood employed a [170]base-12 system of numbers, because, as Sidis
   explained, "The unit in selling things is 12 of those things [dozens]
   and 12 is the smallest number that has four factors!"^[[171]cite this
   quote]

[[172]edit] Legacy

   Abraham Sperling, director of New York City's Aptitude Testing
   Institute, said after Sidis's death that according to his calculations,
   Sidis "easily had an [173]IQ between 250 and 300", meaning that at some
   time his intellectual age was 2.5 to 3 times his actual age (not the
   same scale as modern deviation IQ^[174][23]). There was no evidence
   that his intellect had declined in adulthood.^[175][24] Boris Sidis
   once dismissed tests of intelligence as "silly, pedantic, absurd, and
   grossly misleading."^[176][25] Sperling commented:

     "What the journalists did not report, and perhaps did not know, was
     that during all the years of his obscure employments he was writing
     original treatises on history, government, economics and political
     affairs. In a visit to his mother's home I was permitted to see the
     contents of a trunkful of original manuscript material that Bill
     Sidis composed."^[177][26]

   Sidis's life and work, particularly his ideas about [178]Native
   Americans, are extensively discussed in [179]Robert M. Pirsig's book
   [180]Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991).

[[181]edit] Sidis in education discussions

   The debate about Sidis's manner of upbringing occurred within a larger
   discourse about the best way to educate children. Newspapers criticized
   Boris Sidis's [182]child-rearing methods. Most educators of the day
   believed that schools should expose children to common experiences to
   create good citizens. Most psychologists thought intelligence was
   hereditary—a position that precluded early childhood education at
   home.^[183][27]

   The difficulties Sidis encountered in dealing with the social structure
   of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing such
   children to rapidly advance through higher education in his day. But
   research in the intervening decades shows that, for the majority of
   gifted students, acceleration (including grade skipping) has beneficial
   effects academically and socially in pre-K through graduate
   school.^[184][28]^[[185]dubious – [186]discuss] Research also indicates
   that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional
   difficulties commonly experienced by gifted children.^[187][29]
   Embracing these findings, several colleges now have procedures for
   early entrance.^[188][30] The [189]Davidson Institute for Talent
   Development has developed a guidebook on the topic.^[190][31]

   Sidis was portrayed derisively in the [191]press of the day. The New
   York Times, for example, described him as "a wonderfully successful
   result of a scientific forcing experiment."^[192][32] His mother later
   noted that newspaper accounts of her son bore little resemblance to
   him.
