George Washington (inventor)

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Jump to: [5]navigation, [6]search
   A pre-World War I ad introduced Washington's coffee to the public.
   Advert from The New York Times, February 23, 1914.

   George Constant Louis Washington^[7][1]^[8][I] (May 1871 – March 29,
   1946) was an [9]American [10]inventor and businessman of
   [11]Anglo-[12]Belgian origin. He is best remembered for his invention
   of an early [13]instant coffee process and for the company he founded
   to [14]mass-produce it, the G. Washington Coffee Company.

   An [15]emigrant from his native Belgium, he arrived in the [16]New York
   area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting
   upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in [17]Central America
   in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a
   company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and [18]New
   Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier
   during [19]World War I. The company's products were also advertised in
   New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made
   Washington wealthy, and he lived in a mansion in [20]Brooklyn and then
   moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he
   lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had
   three children.

   Washington's company was sold to [21]American Home Products in 1943,
   shortly before his death. Though the coffee brand was discontinued by
   1961, Washington's name is still used today in the product G.
   Washington's Seasoning & Broth.

[[31]edit] Early life and family

   George Washington was born in [32]Kortrijk, Belgium,^[33][2]^[34][II]
   in May 1871^[35][3] to an English father and a Belgian
   mother.^[36][3]^[37][4] Following then-current [38]nationality law
   which considered fatherhood primary, Washington was a British subject
   until he was naturalized as an American in May 1918.^[39][5] At least
   six siblings in the family also settled in different parts of the
   United States and Central America.^[40][2] A number of accounts claim a
   relation to [41]U.S. President [42]George Washington, but this is not
   clearly explained.^[43][6]

   Washington came to reside in [44]Brussels, and also attained a degree
   in chemistry at the [45]University of Bonn in [46]Germany.^[47][4] In
   December 1895, Washington married Angeline Céline Virginie (in the
   U.S., she just called herself "Lina") Van Nieuwenhuyse (born 1876),
   also from Belgium.^[48][1]^[49][3]^[50][7] The US Census of 1900
   records that Lina, like her husband, had English and Belgian ancestry
   (a Belgian father and an English mother).^[51][3] The Washingtons'
   arrival in the United States on a ship from [52]Antwerp, [53]Belgium,
   on October 6, 1896 was recorded at [54]Ellis Island, though the 1900 US
   Census states that they emigrated to the United States in 1897.^[55][3]
   They settled in the New York area, where they had three
   children.^[56][3]^[57][8] The Washingtons' three children were: Louisa
   Washington (born May 1897),^[58][3] Irene Washington (born May
   1898)^[59][3] and George Washington Jr. (born August
   1899).^[60][3]^[61][9]

   After arriving in the New York area, Washington founded a company
   producing kerosene [62]gas mantles.^[63][2] At this time they lived in
   [64]New Brighton on [65]Staten Island, but his company, George
   Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby [66]Jersey City. This
   business was abandoned with the maturation of [67]incandescent light
   bulb technology.^[68][4] Washington also had a camera company for a
   time. By the time of the [69]1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in
   the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented
   house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young
   children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of
   two of the servants.^[70][3]

   Washington tried his hand at cattle [71]ranching^[72][4] in
   [73]Guatemala in 1906^[74][10]^[75][11] or 1907,^[76][4] but in the
   meantime developed his instant coffee process. Washington returned to
   New York City after only a period of about a year^[77][2] in Guatemala,
   and then began pursuing the main part of his career in coffee
   manufacture.

[[78]edit] Personal life

   After his coffee business was established in 1910, Washington lived in
   Brooklyn at 47 Prospect Park West,^[79][5] with a second home in
   [80]Bellport in [81]Suffolk County at 287 South Country
   Road.^[82][12]^[83][IV] Washington sold both his homes in 1926–1927
   (for a price reportedly exceeding [84]$1 million) to a group of wealthy
   Brooklyn men intent on founding a social club.^[85][13]^[86][14] With
   his company's relocation to New Jersey, following the purchase of land
   there in 1927, he moved to the former estate of Governor [87]Franklin
   Murphy at "Franklin Farms" in [88]Mendham.^[89][15] Washington was a
   lover of exotic animals, as well as gardening.^[90][12] He maintained
   extensive [91]menageries on his country properties, first at Bellport,
   and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often
   seen with a bird or monkey on his shoulder.^[92][12] At both his
   menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds,^[93][13]^[94][4] but
   such animals as [95]deer, [96]sheep, [97]goats, and [98]antelope are
   also recorded at Bellport,^[99][13] and deer, [100]llamas and
   [101]zebras are recorded among the hundreds of animals in the larger
   space at Mendham.^[102][2] Socially, he was an active member of the
   [103]Lotos Club, a literary [104]gentlemen's club in New York
   City.^[105][2]

   Washington's name was briefly put forward for the [106]1920
   presidential election in [107]South Dakota's preference primary for the
   "American Party", although papers were filed too late to be
   valid.^[108][5] There is no indication, however, that the nomination
   was serious. George Washington would not have been eligible for that
   office, in any case, as he was foreign-born. There have been several
   "American Party"s in history—it is unclear if the nomination was a
   particular satire on any so-named movement at the time.^[109][III]

   That's the fellow. He has put one over on us. He has a barrel of
   money—enough to run a slambang campaign. Why, don't you remember, he
   just bought that $100,000 mansion from Albert Feltman on [110]Prospect
   Park West. He's learned a lot about politics by being a neighbor of
   [111]Senator Calder and George Hamlin Childs. And when you come to
   think of it, that American Party stuff is good campaign dope this year,
   what with all the [112]Bolsheviki and the [113]Government after the
   Reds and the row about the [114]League of Nations, and all that. We've
   been overlooking something for sure.

   —Brooklyn politician (unnamed), The New York Times, 4 January
   1920^[115][5]

[[116]edit] Invention and business

   This advertisement compares instant coffee to the "purity" of white
   refined [117]sugar. Advert from The New York Times, January 2, 1922.

   George Washington held over two dozen [118]patents, in the fields of
   [119]hydrocarbon lamps, [120]cameras and [121]food processing. He was
   not the first to invent an instant coffee process, as [122]Satori
   Kato's work was a notable precursor, among others, but Washington's
   invention was the first effort that led to commercial manufacture.
   There is some suggestion that he was inspired by seeing dried powder on
   the edge of a silver [123]coffee pot.^[124][16] Federico Lehnhoff Wyld,
   a German-Guatemalan, also developed an instant coffee process about
   this time,^[125][11] which he later marketed in Europe; as Wyld was
   Washington's personal doctor, there has been some suggestion that the
   discovery was not independent.^[126][10]

   Washington's product was first marketed as Red E Coffee (a pun on
   "ready") in 1909, and the G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was
   founded in 1910.^[127][10] Washington's first production plant was at
   147 41st Street in Brooklyn's Bush Terminal industrial complex. The
   company later moved operations to New Jersey, acquiring the land for
   the new plant at 45 East Hanover Avenue in [128]Morris Plains in
   1927.^[129][15]^[130][IV]

   Advertising for the company's product often emphasized its supposed
   convenience, modernity and purity. It was claimed to be better for
   digestion, and even that the "pure" coffee did not have the wakefulness
   effect of coffee from ground beans (a direct effect of [131]caffeine
   content, present in both forms). After [132]World War I ended, the
   American military's use of the coffee became another selling point. A
   different avenue for promotion came when the company sponsored a
   "[133]Sherlock Holmes" radio series on [134]NBC and the [135]Blue
   Network from 1930 to 1935.^[136][17]

   But the early instant coffee was also often considered of poor quality,
   of disagreeable taste, and little more than a novelty
   product.^[137][18]

   Washington experienced some [138]tax trouble with [139]federal
   authorities, concerning the financial relationship between himself and
   his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company for the
   use of his [140]trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee, and a
   month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family.
   The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family
   members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals,
   and then to the [141]Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the
   Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the [142]Supreme
   Court was not accepted.^[143][19]

   Washington's son, George Washington Jr., served for a time as treasurer
   of his father's company, and, like his father, dabbled in invention,
   patenting a widely used [144]photoengraving process for newspapers that
   was introduced by [145]Fairchild Camera and Instrument in
   1948.^[146][20]

[[147]edit] Military contracts

   After World War I, the coffee was reintroduced to the public with the
   slogan, Went to War! Home Again. Advert from the New York Tribune, June
   22, 1919.

   Washington's at-that-time unique product saw major use as [148]combat
   rations in [149]World War I. Coffee consumption on the battlefield was
   seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a caffeine boost.^[150][18]
   E.F. Holbrook, the head of the coffee section of the [151]U.S. War
   Department at the time, also considered it an important aid in recovery
   from [152]mustard gas.^[153][10] It was employed by the [154]Canadian
   Expeditionary Force from 1914 until the [155]American Expeditionary
   Force entered the war in 1917, and all production was [156]shifted
   toward American military use.^[157][6] New, smaller producers also
   sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army, which
   in the final period of the war was six times the national
   supply.^[158][11]

   The instant coffee achieved some popularity with the soldiers, who
   [159]nicknamed it a "cup of George". As the prime attraction was the
   caffeine boost, rather than the flavor, it was sometimes drunk
   cold.^[160][11]
   “ I am very happy despite the rats, the rain, the mud, the draughts
     [sic], the roar of the cannon and the scream of shells. It takes only a
     minute to light my little oil heater and make some George Washington
     Coffee... Every night I offer up a special petition to the health and
     well-being of Mr. Washington.                                          ”

   —American soldier, 1918 letter from the trenches^[161][11]

   American emergency rations in World War I consisted of a quarter
   [162]ounce (7 [163]grams) packet of double-strength instant coffee,
   packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for
   twenty-four men.^[164][6] Instant coffee was also utilized in reserve
   rations and [165]trench rations. During [166]World War II, the
   [167]U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time on an
   equal footing with the other major instant coffee brands that had
   emerged in the [168]interwar period, most notably [169]Nescafé, as well
   as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military
   demand.^[170][18]

[[171]edit] Fate of man and company

   G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was purchased by [172]American
   Home Products in 1943, and George Washington retired. The purchase of
   the company, which was mostly held by the family, was in exchange for
   29,860 [173]shares (approx. $1.7 million) of American Home Products
   [174]stock, at a time when American Home Products was in a period of
   intense buying, purchasing 34 companies in eight
   years.^[175][21]^[176][22] Clarence Mark, general manager of G.
   Washington, succeeded Washington in running the merged unit.^[177][21]

   In Washington's final years, he sold the "Franklin Farms" property, and
   lived in a home on New Vernon Road in Mendham.^[178][4] He died three
   years after his company was sold, on March 29, 1946,^[179][2] after an
   illness, at the age of 74. His funeral was held three days
   later.^[180][23]

   G. Washington coffee was discontinued as a brand by 1961, when
   Washington's New Jersey plant was sold to Tenco, by then a division of
   [181]The Coca-Cola Company.^[182][18] The last remnant of the brand
   survives in G. Washington's Seasoning & Broth, a sideline developed in
   1938. This brand was sold by American Home Products in 2000, and, after
   passing through a couple of intermediaries, has been run by Homestat
   Farm, Ltd. since 2001.^[183][24]

[[211]edit] Notes

          I[212]^ : He does not appear to have used his full name while in
          the United States—it is absent from census and immigration
          records, his patent applications and contemporary news articles
          about him.
          II[213]^ : The New York Times gives the place of birth as
          Kortrijk, while The New York Herald Tribune gives Brussels. It
          is presumed that the more obscure city would be the less likely
          error. Belgian records clearly indicate that he was at least
          married in Kortrijk.^[214][1]
          III[215]^ : In 1920, former Texas governor [216]James E.
          Ferguson actually ran under an "American Party" label.
          IV[217]^ : The Bellport home is currently known as
          "[218]Washington Lodge". The Morris Plains address at 45 Hanover
          Avenue is given in a [219]1928 ad; the plant is described in the
          New York Times as adjoining the [220]Morristown Line, so the
          address must be 45 East Hanover Avenue.
