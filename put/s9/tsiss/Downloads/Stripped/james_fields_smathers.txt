[[15]edit] Early life

   Smathers was born on a farm near Valley Spring, Texas, the son of James
   Jefferson and Harriet Olenzo Smathers. After attending the local
   one-room country school he entered [16]Texas Christian University in
   1904. He finished business school, taught [17]shorthand and typing for
   a year, and in 1908 became typist, accountant, and credit manager to a
   company in [18]Kansas City, Missouri.

[[19]edit] Career

   Smathers realized during the course of his employment that there was a
   great need for some method of increasing the speed and decreasing the
   operator fatigue of typing, and it seemed obvious to him that electric
   power was the answer. By late 1912 he had produced a working model of
   his electric typewriter and applied for a patent, which was issued the
   following year.^[20][1]

   He continued developing his idea until in September 1914 he produced a
   perfected model that performed perfectly. In 1920 he obtained an
   extension of his early patent because of the delay caused in his work
   by his military service in Europe during [21]World War I.

   In 1923 the Northeast Electric Company of [22]Rochester, New York
   entered into a contract with Smathers for the production of electric
   typewriters. Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their
   electric motors and developed Smathers' design so that it could be
   marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington Electric
   typewriters were produced powered by Northeast's motors.

   After some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, Northeast
   asked Remington for a firm contract for the next batch. However,
   Remington was engaged in merger talks which would eventually result in
   the creation of [23]Remington Rand and no executives were willing to
   commit to a firm order. Northeast instead decided to enter the
   typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first
   Electromatic Typewriter.

   In 1928 [24]General Motors' [25]Delco division purchased Northeast
   Electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as the Electromatic
   Typewriters, Inc., and in 1933 Electromatic was acquired by IBM and the
   typewriter sold as the [26]IBM Electromatic. Smathers joined IBM's
   [27]Rochester staff in 1938 as a consultant and worked in development
   engineering at Poughkeepsie until his retirement in 1953.

   Smathers died on August 7, 1967, in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was
   buried in Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery. He was survived by his wife,
   Mildred Eloise Gill Smathers, and a son and daughter.

[[28]edit] Awards

     * The [29]Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania awarded Smathers the
       [30]Edward Longstreth Medal "for ingenuity in the invention of the
       electric typewriter."

     * In 1945 the [31]Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences awarded him
       Smathers a Fellowship for the invention of a mechanism for
       [32]proportional spacing.

     * In 1966 the Alumni Association of Texas Christian University
       recognized Smathers as a "distinguished alumnus."
