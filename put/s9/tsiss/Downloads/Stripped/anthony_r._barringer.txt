   Anthony R. “Tony” Barringer (October 20, 1925 - August 15, 2009) is a
   [12]Canadian/[13]American [14]geophysicist. He has made numerous
   contributions to [15]mineral exploration technology. His most famous
   work was the development of the INPUT airborne [16]electromagnetic
   system, which has been credited in the discovery of tens of billions of
   dollars worth of [17]ore deposits.

   Before beginning his university studies, Barringer served with the
   [18]British Army in [19]World War II. In 1948, he began attending the
   [20]University of London. In 1951, he obtained a [21]B.Sc. in
   [22]economic geology from the university’s [23]Imperial College of
   Science and Technology. He obtained a [24]PhD degree in 1954, from the
   same institution.

[[29]edit] Career

   Barringer left the [30]United Kingdom to accept a post in [31]Toronto,
   Canada with Selco Exploration as an exploration geologist. Eventually
   he was promoted to Manager of its Airborne and Technical Services
   division. At this time, he invented the INPUT (Induced Pulse Transient)
   airborne electromagnetic system and the equipment for a portable ground
   electromagnetic system. This technology uses one horizital transmitter
   looped around a fixed wing aircraft and a vertically suspended receiver
   loop about 120 meters behind the aircraft. The transmitter
   electromagnetic pulses are half sine wave shape of millisecond
   duration, the induced transient is picked up by the receiver coil;
   analysis of the received wave pattern when matched against a catalog of
   waves forms generated in the lab based upon analog scale modeling
   allows explorers to get a better understanding of the [32]minerals in a
   [33]rock formation, without extracting the rocks^[34][1]. The
   [35]Society of Exploration Geophysicists said INPUT was “a meritorious
   technical achievement which has been instrumental in the discovery of
   many [36]base metal deposits in a number of countries around the
   world.”

   In 1961, he formed a private company, Barringer Research Ltd^[37][2].
   He was the President and major shareholder. Barringer continued to
   develop the airborne system and licenses its use to exploration
   companies. Major oil and mining companies depended on this
   remote-sensing technology for their exploration. It has been credited
   in the discovery of over 25 commercial ore deposits, representing tens
   of billions of dollars.

   Barringer Research went public in 1967. Ten years later, Barringer
   moved to [38]Denver, Colorado and brought the company's headquarters
   with him. He later became a citizen of the United States.

   Barringer made numerous technical contributions to the mining industry,
   including a [39]laser-induced fluorescence-based system used primarily
   in oil and gas exploration (FLUOROSCAN), [40]correlation
   [41]spectrometer used to measure [42]atmospheric dispersions of various
   gases (COSPEC), an [43]infrared remote sensor for atmospheric gases
   which has been used by NASA to measure the worldwide atmospheric
   distribution of [44]carbon dioxide (GASPEC), two airborne conductivity
   mapping systems using [45]very low frequency fields (E-phase and
   radiophase) and several particulate analyzers (COTRAN, SURTRACE,
   LASERTRACE and AIRTRACE). He has presented more than 80 technical
   papers and has been awarded more than 70 patents in Canada, the U.S.,
   and other countries.

   In 1989, Barringer officially retired. He died in Golden, Colorado at
   the age of 84^[46][3]
