   [14]entrepreneur who is best known as the inventor of the upside-down
   [15]aerosol [16]spray paint can. He was previously the owner of Fox
   Valley Systems, a company that markets his spray paint applicators,
   however he sold the company to his sons in 2006. He is also known for

   population from just 50 horses when he began), and for opening the
   short-lived Shireland theme park.

[[25]edit] Early life

   Smrt was born in 1928. His father died when he was 4 years old and he
   had several different stepfathers growing up. He did not advance past
   the 8th grade, however he went on to serve in the military and
   eventually become a [26]self-made millionaire and businessman. Smrt
   later married Mary D. Rose and had four children, Thomas, Michael, Mary
   and John.

[[27]edit] Inventions

   Smrt's most notable invention is the upside-down aerosol spray paint
   can: a can of spray paint that can be applied while holding the can
   upside down (which is impossible with typical spray paint cans). This
   is widely used in [28]municipal and highway applications for outlining
   parking lots, turn lanes, center lines, crosswalks, etc. They are also
   commonly used for painting hashmarks and lines on athletic fields. His
   patents date back to 1977 and include paint application devices, vacuum
   sealed packing materials,^[29][1] [30]geodesic domes,^[31][2] and
   mechanical arms.^[32][3]

[[33]edit] Charity

   Smrt is known for varied charitable donations. On one particular
   occasion, he called his local police department to ask if they needed
   anything.^[34][4] When the officer answering the phone mentioned that
   they needed a new booking camera and some "first response" pocketknives
   (used to cut away [35]seat belts from car accident victims), Smrt
   purchased the items and had them sent to the station. When one of his
   employees presented them to the police, he stated "Mr. Smrt would like
   other industries to follow his lead. So many departments go without
   some of the things they need. It makes him happy to return favors for
   all the work the department does."^[36][4]

[[37]edit] Horse breeding

   Smrt owns Fox Valley Farms in [38]Marengo, Illinois, where he breeds,
   shows and sells rare Shire horses. At one time, there were only 50 of
   this breed left in the world. Smrt took an interest in them, shipped
   some to his farm and began breeding them. By the mid 1980s, their
   numbers had increased significantly, to the point that he was able to
   donate 40 of the horses to the Caisson Unit of the [39]United States
   Army (used for parades and demonstrations).

   Fox Valley Farms was used as a filming location in the 1986 film
   [40]Nothing in Common, starring [41]Tom Hanks and [42]Jackie Gleason.
   Smrt himself has a small role in the film as "Mr. Egan".

[[43]edit] Shireland

   On May 28, 1988, Smrt held the grand opening for a new shire
   horse-based theme park on Dietrich Road and Lake Street in
   [44]Hampshire, Illinois.^[45][5] The park covered 111 acres (0.45 km^2)
   and contained a 68,000-square-foot (6,300 m^2) circus tent as well as
   four 10,000-square-foot (930 m^2) exhibit tents.^[46][5] The concept
   centered around the horses, however it also incorporated traditional
   [47]clown shows. It followed a medieval theme, with area names like
   "dragonwood" (a small forest which incorporated a tram ride,
   animatronic dragons, and "shire knights riding shire horses). At the
   end of the summer 1988, Shireland shut down for unspecified reasons and
   did not reopen until 1991. It was only open for a month in 1991, after
   which it closed permanently. The property sat mostly untouched for 15
   years thereafter and became a popular place for [48]urban exploration
   groups to take photographs. In June 2005, Smrt sold the property to a
   developer who began demolishing the existing buildings but had no
   specific plans to develop the property.^[49][6]
