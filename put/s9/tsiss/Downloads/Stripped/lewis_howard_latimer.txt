[[20]edit] Early life

   Lewis Howard Latimer was born in [21]Chelsea, Massachusetts on
   September 4 1848 as the youngest of the four children of Rebecca
   (1826-1848) and George Latimer (July 4, 1818 ^[22][1] -c.1880). George
   Latimer had been the [23]slave of James B. Gray of [24]Virginia. George
   Latimer ran away to freedom in [25]Trenton, New Jersey in October,
   1842, along with his wife Rebecca, who had been the slave of another
   man. When Gray, the owner, appeared in Boston to take them back to
   Virginia, it became a noted case in the movement for abolition of
   slavery, gaining the involvement of such abolitionists as [26]William
   Lloyd Garrison. Eventually funds were raised to pay Gray $400 for the
   freedom of George Latimer.^[27][1] Lewis Latimer joined the [28]U.S.
   Navy at the age of 15 on September 16, 1863. After receiving an
   honorable discharge from the Navy on July 3, 1865, he gained employment
   as an office boy with a [29]patent law firm, Crosby Halstead and Gould,
   with a $3.00 per week salary. He learned how to use an L square, ruler,
   and other tools. Later, after his boss recognized his talent for
   sketching patent drawings, Latimer was promoted to the position of head
   draftsman earning $20.00 a week by 1878.^[30][1] In 1874, he co
   patented (with Charles W. Brown) an improved toilet system for railroad
   cars called the Water Closet for Railroad Cars (U.S. Patent 147,363).

   In 1876, [31]Alexander Graham Bell employed Latimer, then a draftsman
   at Bell's patent law firm, to draft the necessary drawings required to
   receive a patent for Bell's telephone.^[32][2]

   In 1879, he moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut with his brother, William,
   his mother, Rebecca, and his wife. Lewis was hired as assistant manager
   and draftsman for the U.S. Electric Lighting Company, a company owned
   by Hiram Maxim, a rival inventor of Thomas Edison. Latimer received a
   patent in January 1881 for the "Process of Manufacturing Carbons", an
   improved method for the production of carbon filaments for lightbulb.
   The Edison Electric Light Company in New York City hired Latimer in
   1884, as a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on
   electric lights.

[[33]edit] Personal life

   He married Mary Wilson on December 10, 1873 and later had two
   daughters, Emma Jeanette (born on June 12, 1883) and Louise Rebecca
   (born April 19, 1890). Mary was born in Rhode Island.^[[34]citation

[[35]edit] Inventions

   In 1874, he copatented (with Charles W. Brown) an improved [36]toilet
   system for railroad cars called the Water Closet for Railroad Cars
   (U.S. Patent 147,363).

   Latimer received a patent in January 1881 for the "Process of
   Manufacturing Carbons", an improved method for the production of
   [37]carbon filaments used in [38]lightbulbs. ^[39][3]

[[40]edit] Legacy

   Latimer is an inductee of the [41]National Inventors Hall of Fame for
   his work on electric filament manufacturing techniques.^[42][4]

   Latimer was a founding member of the Flushing, New York Unitarian
   Church. Latimer's home has been moved to a small park in [43]Flushing,
   New York and turned into a museum in honor of the inventor.^[44][5]

   A set of apartment houses in Flushing are known as "Latimer Gardens".
   ^[45][6]

   P.S. 56 in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, is named Lewis H. Latimer School in
   Latimer's honor
