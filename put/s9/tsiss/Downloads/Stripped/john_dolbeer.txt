                         John Dolbeer
      Born    March 12, 1827(1827-03-12)
              [7]Epsom, [8]Merrimack County, [9]New Hampshire
      Died    August 17, 1902(1902-08-17) (aged 75)
              [10]San Francisco
   Occupation [11]Inventor, [12]entrepreneur
     Spouse   Harriet Schander

   John Dolbeer (March 12, 1827 – August 17, 1902) was a partner in the
   Dolbeer & Carson Lumber Co., one of the early major [13]Humboldt
   County, California lumber operations in based in [14]Eureka. While in
   that business, he invented the [15]logging engine, more commonly known
   as the [16]steam donkey or [17]donkey engine. This invaluable
   equipment, especially with regard to difficult terrain and very large
   trees, revolutionized 19th century logging so significantly that
   variations of the engine were still used well into the 20th Century.

[[24]edit] Early years

   John Dolbeer was born in [25]Epsom, [26]Merrimack County, [27]New
   Hampshire on March 12, 1827, the son of Nicholas Dolbeer and Esther
   Chase of New Rye. He left the family farm in 1850 at the age of 23 and
   set out to the [28]California Gold Rush to make his fortune.

[[29]edit] Entrepreneurship

   Looking for opportunity beyond the mines, Dolbeer arrived at the
   [30]Humboldt Bay area where in 1853 he purchased Martin White's Bay
   Mill in Eureka, California. Finding himself in need of capital after
   fire destroyed his mill twice, he became partners with William Carson
   (builder of the [31]Carson Mansion) by the spring of 1863. The two
   formed what would become one of the first truly huge Redwood lumber
   operations, the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company.^[32][1] The mill
   operated with his name on it on the Eureka waterfront until the 1970s.

[[33]edit] Patents

   "Logging Engine" Patent 256,553

   His several patents showed his ingenuity in problem solving, and he had
   an impact in all facets of the industry, from the actual lumbering
   operation itself, to transporting and exporting – even owning the
   [34]barques and [35]brigs to ship the lumber to worldwide markets.
   Among his most useful and successful patent was that for the Dolbeer
   Logging Engine in August 1881.^[36][2] This machine was a simple steam
   engine mounted on a wooden skid which enabled loggers to employ cables
   to move giant logs across long distances or steep terrain to adjacent
   railways or waterways. This invention improved log retrieval in
   difficult terrain and revolutionized the industry. It was so cost
   effective and useful that the technology continued to be used well into
   the 20th century. Examples of working Donkey engines can still be found
   operating during special occasions at [37]Fort Humboldt State Historic
   Park in Eureka. The patent ([38]Patent number: 256553) was issued April
   18, 1882.^[39][3]

   Other patents include an apparatus for "steaming [40]piles" ([41]Patent
   number: 333204) and a device used for measuring footage of timber cut
   by a sawmill ([42]Patent number: 45482).

[[43]edit] Family

   In 1872, late in life, he married Harriet Schander, and in 1873 his
   son, Chase Dolbeer was born. He established his home on Lombard Street
   in [44]San Francisco. Four years later, in 1877, the Dolbeers had their
   daughter, Bertha. Business continued to thrive, despite early lumber
   mill fires. It was about the time of the second fire that the personal
   life of Jonathan Dolbeer turned tragic. In 1879, Harriet committed
   suicide and was called by the [45]San Francisco Call "a suffering
   invalid", and in 1886 his son Chase was thrown from a wagon and died at
   the age of 13. His family endured yet a final tragedy after his death
   when on July 9, 1904, his daughter Bertha committed suicide at the
   [46]Waldorf Astoria in New York City, putting the battle for the estate
   in the California Courts through 1908.^[47][4]

[[48]edit] Estate

   John Dolbeer died in San Francisco from a heart ailment on August 17,
   1902. He was laid to rest in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, San
   Mateo County, California^[49][5]. The bulk of his estate went to his
   lone surviving daughter Bertha, and was worth nearly one million
   dollars. Additional sums were given to several charities, and relatives
   in Epsom, including his niece Ellen Dolbeer Hall (daughter of his
   brother Calvin) and her husband, Charles Sumner Hall. There is now a
   prestigious scholarship awarded at the University of California,
   Berkeley in his name and honor.
