   ^a [42]Austrian Empire (1804–1867) reorganized and renamed into the
   [43]Austria-Hungary (1867-1918) in 1867.

   Nikola Tesla ([44]Serbian: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943)
   was an [45]inventor, [46]mechanical engineer, and [47]electrical
   engineer. He was an important contributor to the birth of commercial
   [48]electricity, and is best known for his many revolutionary
   developments in the field of [49]electromagnetism in the late 19th and
   early 20th centuries. [50]Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed
   the basis of modern [51]alternating current (AC) [52]electric power
   systems, including the [53]polyphase system of electrical distribution
   and the [54]AC motor. This work helped usher in the [55]Second
   Industrial Revolution.

   Born an ethnic [56]Serb in the village of [57]Smiljan (now part of
   [58]Gospić), then part of the [59]Austrian Empire (modern-day
   [60]Croatia). Tesla was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and
   later became an American citizen.^[61][1] Because of his 1894
   demonstration of wireless communication through [62]radio and as the
   eventual victor in the "[63]War of Currents", he was widely respected
   as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in
   America.^[64][2] He pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of
   his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. In the United States
   during this time, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or
   scientist in history or popular culture.^[65][3] Tesla demonstrated
   [66]wireless energy transfer to power electronic devices as early as
   1893, and aspired to intercontinental wireless transmission of
   industrial power in his unfinished [67]Wardenclyffe Tower project.

   Because of his eccentric personality and his seemingly unbelievable and
   sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological
   developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a [68]mad
   scientist by many late in his life.^[69][4] Tesla never put much focus
   on his finances and died with little funds at the age of 86, alone in
   the two room hotel suite in which he lived, in New York City.^[70][5]

   The [71]International System of Units unit measuring [72]magnetic field
   B (also referred to as the magnetic flux density and magnetic
   induction), the [73]tesla, was named in his honor (at the Conférence
   Générale des Poids et Mesures, Paris, 1960).

   In addition to his work on electromagnetism and [74]electromechanical
   [75]engineering, Tesla contributed in varying degrees to the
   establishment of [76]robotics, [77]remote control, [78]radar, and
   [79]computer science, and to the expansion of [80]ballistics,
   [81]nuclear physics, and [82]theoretical physics.

Early years

   Nikola Tesla's birth house and statue in the village of [110]Smiljan,
   [111]Croatia
   c.1879 at age 23

   Tesla was born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan,
   [112]Austrian Empire near the town of [113]Gospić, in the territory of
   modern-day Croatia. His baptismal certificate reports that he was born
   on 28 June ([114]N.S. 10 July), 1856, to Father Milutin Tesla, a priest
   in the [115]Serbian Orthodox Church.^[116][6] His paternal origin is
   thought to be either of one of the local [117]Serb clans in the
   [118]Tara valley or from the [119]Herzegovinian noble [120]Pavle
   Orlović.^[121][7] His mother, Đuka, daughter of a Serbian Orthodox
   Church priest, came from a family domiciled in Lika and [122]Banija,
   but with deeper origins to [123]Kosovo. She was talented in making home
   craft tools and memorized many [124]Serbian epic poems, but never
   learned to read.^[125][8]

   Nikola was the fourth of five children, having one older brother (Dane,
   who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five) and
   three sisters (Milka, Angelina and Marica).^[126][9] His family moved
   to Gospić in 1862. Tesla attended school at [127]Higher Real Gymnasium
   in [128]Karlovac.^[129][10] He finished a four-year term in the span of
   three years.^[130][11]

   Tesla went on to study electrical engineering at the [131]Austrian
   Polytechnic in [132]Graz (1875). While there, he studied the uses of
   alternating current. Some sources say he received Baccalaureate degrees
   from the university at Graz.^[133][12]^[134][13]^[135][14] However, the
   university says that he did not receive a degree and did not continue
   beyond the first semester of his third year, during which he stopped
   attending lectures.^[136][15]^[137][16]^[138][17]^[139][18] In December
   1878, Tesla left Graz and broke all relations with his family. His
   friends thought that he had drowned in the [140]Mura River. He went to
   [141]Marburg, (today's Maribor, in [142]Slovenia), where he was first
   employed as an assistant engineer for a year. He suffered a
   [143]nervous breakdown during this time. Tesla was later persuaded by
   his father to attend the [144]Charles-Ferdinand University in
   [145]Prague, which he attended for the summer term of 1880. Here, he
   was influenced by [146]Ernst Mach. However, after his father died, he
   left the university, having completed only one term.^[147][19]

   Tesla engaged in reading many works, memorizing complete books,
   supposedly having a [148]photographic memory.^[149][20] Tesla related
   in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of
   inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness
   time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which
   blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often
   accompanied by visions. Much of the time the visions were linked to a
   word or idea he might have come across, at other times they would
   provide the solution to a particular problem he had been encountering;
   just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in
   realistic detail. Modern-day [150]synesthetes report similar symptoms.
   Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision,
   including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage; a
   technique sometimes known as [151]picture thinking. He typically did
   not make drawings by hand, instead just conceiving all ideas with his
   mind. Tesla also often had flashbacks to events that had happened
   previously in his life; these began during his childhood.^[152][20]

   In 1880, he moved to [153]Budapest to work under [154]Tivadar Puskás in
   a [155]telegraph company,^[156][21] the National [157]Telephone
   Company. There, he met Nebojša Petrović, a young, Serbian inventor who
   lived in Austria. Although their encounter was brief, they did work on
   a project together using twin turbines to create continual power. On
   the opening of the [158]telephone exchange in Budapest, 1881, Tesla
   became the chief electrician to the company, and was later engineer for
   the country's first telephone system. He also developed a device that,
   according to some, was a [159]telephone [160]repeater or
   [161]amplifier, but according to others could have been the first
   [162]loudspeaker.^[163][22]

   alternating current motor invention

France and the United States

   In 1882 he moved to Paris, to work as an engineer for the Continental
   Edison Company, designing improvements to electric equipment brought
   overseas from Edison's ideas. According to his autobiography, in the
   same year he conceived the [165]induction motor and began developing
   various devices that use [166]rotating magnetic fields for which he
   received patents in 1888.

   Soon thereafter, Tesla was awakened from a dream in which his mother
   had died.^[167][23] After her death, Tesla fell ill. He spent two to
   three weeks recuperating in Gospić and the village of Tomingaj near
   [168]Gračac, his mother's birthplace.

   On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York
   City^[169][24] with little besides a letter of recommendation from
   [170]Charles Batchelor, a former employer. In the letter of
   recommendation to [171]Thomas Edison, it is claimed that Batchelor
   wrote, 'I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this
   young man', but the exact contents of the letter is disputed in
   McNichol's book. Edison hired Tesla to work for his Edison Machine
   Works. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering
   and quickly progressed to solving some of the company's most difficult
   problems. Tesla was even offered the task of completely redesigning the
   Edison company's [172]direct current [173]generators.^[174][25]

   Tesla claimed he was offered [175]US$50,000 (~ US$1.1 million in 2007,
   adjusted for inflation)^[176][26] if he redesigned Edison's inefficient
   motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and
   economy.^[177][27] In 1885 when Tesla inquired about the payment for
   his work, Edison replied, "Tesla, you don't understand our
   [178]American humor," thus breaking his word.^[179][28]^[180][29]
   Earning US$18 per week, Tesla would have had to work for 53 years to
   earn the amount he was promised. The offer was equal to the initial
   capital of the company. Tesla immediately resigned when he was refused
   a raise to US$25 per week.^[181][30]

   Tesla, in need of work, eventually found himself digging ditches for a
   short period of time for the Edison company. He used this time to focus
   on his AC polyphase system.^[182][31]

   In 1886, Tesla formed his own company, [240]Tesla Electric Light &
   Manufacturing. The initial financial investors disagreed with Tesla on
   his plan for an alternating current motor and eventually relieved him
   of his duties at the company. Tesla worked in New York as a laborer
   from 1886 to 1887 to feed himself and raise capital for his next
   project. In 1887, he constructed the initial [241]brushless alternating
   current [242]induction motor, which he demonstrated to the American
   Institute of Electrical Engineers (now [243]IEEE) in 1888. In the same
   year, he developed the principles of his [244]Tesla coil, and began
   working with [245]George Westinghouse at [246]Westinghouse Electric &
   Manufacturing Company's [247]Pittsburgh labs. Westinghouse listened to
   his ideas for polyphase systems which would allow transmission of
   alternating current electricity over long distances.

   In April 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called
   [248]X-rays using his own single terminal [249]vacuum tubes (similar to
   his patent [250]#514,170). This device differed from other early X-ray
   tubes in that it had no target electrode. The modern term for the
   phenomenon produced by this device is [251]bremsstrahlung (or braking
   radiation). We now know that this device operated by emitting
   [252]electrons from the single electrode through a combination of
   [253]field electron emission and [254]thermionic emission. Once
   liberated, electrons are strongly repelled by the high [255]electric
   field near the electrode during negative voltage peaks from the
   oscillating HV output of the Tesla Coil, generating X rays as they
   collide with the glass envelope. He also used [256]Geissler tubes. By
   1892, Tesla became aware of the skin damage that [257]Wilhelm Röntgen
   later identified as an effect of X rays.

   In the early research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to
   produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument
   will [... enable one to] generate [258]Roentgen rays of much greater
   power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus".^[259][47]

   He also commented on the hazards of working with his circuit and
   single-node X-ray-producing devices. Of his many notes in the early
   investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to
   various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not
   caused by the Roentgen rays, but the [260]ozone generated in contact
   with the skin, and to a lesser extent, [261]nitrous acid. Tesla
   incorrectly held that x-rays were [262]longitudinal waves, such as
   those produced in [263]waves in plasma. There are known examples of
   this and these plasma waves can occur in the situation of
   [264]force-free magnetic fields.^[265][48]^[266][49] His hypotheses and
   experiments were confirmed by others.^[267][50]

   Tesla continued research in the field. He performed several experiments
   prior to Roentgen's discovery (including photographing the bones of his
   hand; later, he sent these images to Roentgen) but did not make his
   findings widely known; much of his research was lost in the 5th Avenue
   laboratory fire of March 1895.

   Tesla demonstrated [268]wireless energy transmission as early as 1891.
   The Tesla effect is a term for an application of this type of
   electrical conduction (that is, the movement of energy through space
   and matter, not just the production of voltage across a
   conductor).^[269][51]^[270][52]

American citizenship

   On 30 July 1891, he became a [271]naturalized citizen of the United
   States at the age of 35. Tesla established his South [272]Fifth Avenue
   laboratory in New York in the same year. Later, Tesla established his
   Houston Street laboratory in New York at 46 E. [273]Houston Street. He
   lit electric lamps wirelessly at both of the New York locations,
   providing evidence for the potential of wireless power
   transmission.^[274][53]

   Some of Tesla's closest friends were artists. He befriended
   [275]Century Magazine editor [276]Robert Underwood Johnson, who adapted
   several Serbian poems of [277]Jovan Jovanović Zmaj (which Tesla
   translated). Also during this time, Tesla was influenced by the
   [278]Vedic philosophy (i.e., [279]Hinduism) teachings of the [280]Swami
   Vivekananda; so much so that, after his exposure to Hindu-Vedic
   thought, Tesla started using [281]Sanskrit words to name some of his
   fundamental concepts regarding matter and energy.^[282][54]
   Nikola Tesla's AC [283]dynamo used to generate AC which is used to
   transport [284]electricity across great distances. It is contained in
   [285]U.S. Patent 390,721.

   When Tesla was 36 years old, the first patents concerning the polyphase
   power system were granted. He continued research of the system and
   rotating magnetic field principles. Tesla served, from 1892 to 1894, as
   the vice president of the [286]American Institute of Electrical
   Engineers, the forerunner (along with the [287]Institute of Radio
   Engineers) of the modern-day [288]IEEE. From 1893 to 1895, he
   investigated [289]high frequency alternating currents. He generated AC
   of one million [290]volts using a conical Tesla coil and investigated
   the [291]skin effect in [292]conductors, designed tuned circuits,
   invented a machine for inducing sleep, cordless [293]gas discharge
   lamps, and transmitted [294]electromagnetic energy without wires,
   building the first [295]radio transmitter. In [296]St. Louis, Missouri,
   Tesla made a demonstration related to radio communication in 1893.
   Addressing the [297]Franklin Institute in [298]Philadelphia,
   [299]Pennsylvania and the [300]National Electric Light Association, he
   described and demonstrated in detail its principles. Tesla's
   demonstrations were written about widely through various media outlets.
   Tesla also investigated harvesting [301]energy that is present
   throughout space. He believed that it was merely a question of time
   when men would succeed in attaching their machinery to the very
   wheelwork of nature, stating: "Ere many generations pass, our machinery
   will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the
   universe."^[302][55]

   At the 1893 [303]World's Fair, the [304]World's Columbian Exposition in
   Chicago, an international exposition was held which, for the first
   time, devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a historic
   event as Tesla and George Westinghouse introduced visitors to [305]AC
   power by using it to illuminate the Exposition. On display were Tesla's
   [306]fluorescent lamps and single node bulbs. An observer noted:

   Within the room was suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin
   foil. These were about fifteen feet apart, and served as terminals of
   the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned
   on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay
   on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the
   hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the
   same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about
   two years previous, "where they produced so much wonder and
   astonishment".^[307][56]

   Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field and
   [308]induction motor by demonstrating how to make an egg made of
   [309]copper stand on end in his demonstration of the device he
   constructed known as the "[310]Egg of Columbus".

   The Tesla generator was developed by Tesla in 1895, in conjunction with
   his developments concerning the [311]liquefaction of air. Tesla knew,
   from Lord Kelvin's discoveries, that more heat is absorbed by liquefied
   air when it is re-gasified and used to drive something, than is
   required by theory; in other words, that the liquefaction process is
   somewhat anomalous or 'over unity'.^[312][57] Just prior to Tesla's
   completion of his work and the filing of a patent application, Tesla's
   laboratory burned down, destroying all his equipment, models and
   inventions. Immediately after the fire, [313]Carl von Linde, in
   Germany, filed a patent application for the same process.^[314][58]

   A "world system" for "the transmission of electrical energy without
   wires" that depends upon the [315]electrical conductivity of the earth
   was proposed, in which transmission in various natural media with
   current that passes between the two points are used to power devices.
   In a practical wireless energy transmission system using this
   principle, a high-power ultraviolet beam might be used to form a
   vertical ionized channel in the air directly above the
   transmitter-receiver stations. The same concept is used in virtual
   [316]lightning rods, the [317]electrolaser [318]electroshock
   weapon,^[319][59] and has been proposed for disabling vehicles.

Edison

   Also in the late 1880s, Tesla and [320]Thomas Edison became adversaries
   in part because of Edison's promotion of direct current (DC) for
   [321]electric power distribution over the more efficient alternating
   current advocated by Tesla and Westinghouse. Until Tesla invented the
   induction motor, AC's advantages for long distance [322]high voltage
   transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on
   AC. As a result of the "[323]War of Currents", Edison and Westinghouse
   went nearly bankrupt, so in 1897, Tesla released Westinghouse from
   contract, providing Westinghouse a break from Tesla's patent royalties.
   Also in 1897, Tesla researched [324]radiation, which led to setting up
   the basic formulation of [325]cosmic rays.^[326][60]

   In 1897, at the age of 41 years old, Tesla filed the first radio patent
   ([327]U.S. Patent 645,576). A year later, he demonstrated a
   [328]radio-controlled boat to the US military, believing that the
   military would want things such as radio-controlled [329]torpedoes.
   Tesla claimed to have developed the "Art of [330]Telautomatics", a form
   of [331]robotics, as well as the technology of remote
   control.^[332][61] In 1898, he demonstrated a radio-controlled boat to
   the public during an electrical exhibition at [333]Madison Square
   Garden. Tesla called his boat a "teleautomaton".^[334][62] In the same
   year, Tesla devised an "electric igniter" or [335]spark plug for
   [336]Internal combustion gasoline engines. He gained [337]U.S. Patent
   609,250, "Electrical Igniter for Gas Engines", on this [338]mechanical
   ignition system. Tesla lived in the former Gerlach Hotel, renamed The
   Radio Wave building, at 49 W 27th St. (between Broadway and Sixth
   Avenue), [339]Lower Manhattan, before the end of the century where he
   conducted the radio wave experiments. A [340]commemorative plaque was
   placed on the building in 1977 to honor his work. Remote [341]radio
   control remained a novelty until WWI and afterward, when a number of
   countries used it in military programs.

   power by means of electrodynamic induction from a nearby transmitter
   A Colorado Springs experiment: here a grounded tuned coil in
   [345]resonance with a distant transmitter illuminates a light near the
   bottom of the picture.

   In 1899, Tesla decided to move and began research in [346]Colorado
   Springs, Colorado in a lab located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa
   St.,^[347][63] where he would have room for his high-voltage,
   high-frequency experiments. Upon his arrival he told reporters that he
   was conducting [348]wireless telegraphy experiments transmitting
   signals from [349]Pikes Peak to Paris. Tesla's diary contains
   explanations of his experiments concerning the [350]ionosphere and the
   ground's [351]telluric currents via [352]transverse waves and
   [353]longitudinal waves.^[354][64] At his lab, Tesla proved that the
   earth was a conductor, and he produced artificial [355]lightning (with
   discharges consisting of millions of volts, and up to 135 feet
   long).^[356][65] Tesla also investigated [357]atmospheric electricity,
   observing lightning signals via his receivers. Reproductions of Tesla's
   receivers and coherer circuits show an unpredicted level of complexity
   (e.g., [358]distributed [359]high-Q [360]helical [361]resonators,
   [362]radio frequency [363]feedback, crude [364]heterodyne effects, and
   [365]regeneration techniques).^[366][66] Tesla stated that he observed
   [367]stationary waves during this time.^[368][67]

   Tesla researched ways to transmit power and energy wirelessly over long
   distances (via transverse waves, to a lesser extent, and, more readily,
   longitudinal waves). He transmitted [369]extremely low frequencies
   through the ground as well as between the Earth's surface and the
   [370]Kennelly–Heaviside layer. He received patents on wireless
   transceivers that developed standing waves by this method. In his
   experiments, he made mathematical calculations and computations based
   on his experiments and discovered that the [371]resonant frequency of
   the Earth was approximately 8 hertz (Hz). In the 1950s, researchers
   confirmed that the resonant frequency of the Earth's ionospheric cavity
   was in this range (later named the [372]Schumann resonance).

   In Colorado Springs Tesla carried out various long distance wireless
   transmission-reception experiments. [373]Tesla effect is the
   application of a type of electrical conduction (that is, the movement
   of energy through space and matter; not just the production of voltage
   across a conductor). Through [374]longitudinal waves, Tesla transferred
   energy to receiving devices. He sent electrostatic forces through
   natural media across a conductor situated in the changing [375]magnetic
   flux and transferred electrical energy to a wireless receiver.

   In the Colorado Springs lab, Tesla observed unusual signals that he
   later thought may have been evidence of [376]extraterrestrial radio
   wave communications coming from [377]Venus or [378]Mars.^[379][68] He
   noticed repetitive signals from his receiver which were substantially
   different from the signals he had noted from storms and earth noise.
   Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of
   one, two, three, and four clicks together. Tesla had mentioned that he
   thought his inventions could be used to talk with other planets. There
   have even been claims that he invented a "[380]Teslascope" for just
   such a purpose. It is debatable what type of signals Tesla received or
   whether he picked up anything at all. Research has suggested that Tesla
   may have had a misunderstanding of the new technology he was working
   with,^[381][69] or that the signals Tesla observed may have been
   non-terrestrial natural radio source such as the [382]Jovian
   [383]plasma torus signals.^[384][70]

   Tesla left [385]Colorado Springs on 7 January 1900. The lab was torn
   down ca. 1905 and its contents sold to pay debts. The Colorado
   experiments prepared Tesla for the establishment of the trans-Atlantic
   wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe.

Wardenclyffe years

   In 1900, with US$150,000 (51% from [386]J. Pierpont Morgan), Tesla
   began planning the [387]Wardenclyffe Tower facility. In June 1902,
   Tesla's lab operations were moved to Wardenclyffe from Houston Street.
   The tower was dismantled for scrap during [388]World War I.^[389][71]
   Newspapers of the time labeled Wardenclyffe "Tesla's million-dollar
   folly". In 1904, the US [390]Patent Office reversed its decision and
   awarded [391]Guglielmo Marconi the patent for radio, and Tesla began
   his fight to re-acquire the radio patent. On his 50th birthday in 1906,
   Tesla demonstrated his 200 [392]hp (150 kW) 16,000 rpm [393]bladeless
   turbine. During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York,
   several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5000 hp.

Nobel prize and Tesla

   Since the [394]Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Marconi for radio
   in 1909, [395]Thomas Edison and Tesla were mentioned in a press
   dispatch as potential laureates to share the [396]Nobel Prize of 1915,
   leading to one of several [397]Nobel Prize controversies. Some sources
   have claimed that because of their animosity toward each other neither
   was given the award, despite their scientific contributions; that each
   sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award;
   that both refused to ever accept the award if the other received it
   first; and that both rejected any possibility of sharing
   it.^[398][8]^[399][72]

   In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the Prize
   (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915, and Tesla
   did receive one bid out of 38 in 1937).^[400][73] Earlier, Tesla alone
   was rumored to have been nominated for the [401]Nobel Prize of 1912.
   The rumored nomination was primarily for his experiments with tuned
   circuits using high-voltage high-frequency resonant transformers.

Later years

   In 1915, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Marconi attempting,
   unsuccessfully, to obtain a court injunction against Marconi's claims.
   After Wardenclyffe, Tesla built the [402]Telefunken Wireless Station in
   Sayville, Long Island. Some of what he wanted to achieve at
   Wardenclyffe was accomplished with the Telefunken Wireless. In 1917,
   the facility was seized and torn down by the [403]Marines, because it
   was suspected that it could be used by German spies.
   The [404]Wardenclyffe Tower facility

   Before [405]World War I, Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund
   his research. When the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was
   receiving from his patents in European countries. After the war ended,
   Tesla made predictions regarding the relevant issues of the post-World
   War I environment, in a printed article (20 December 1914). Tesla
   believed that the [406]League of Nations was not a remedy for the times
   and issues. Tesla started to exhibit pronounced symptoms of
   [407]obsessive-compulsive disorder in the years following. He became
   obsessed with the number three; he often felt compelled to walk around
   a block three times before entering a building, demanded a stack of
   three folded cloth napkins beside his plate at every meal, etc. The
   nature of OCD was little understood at the time and no treatments were
   available, so his symptoms were considered by some to be evidence of
   partial insanity, and this undoubtedly hurt what was left of his
   reputation.

   At this time, he was staying at [408]The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, renting
   in an arrangement for deferred payments. Eventually, the Wardenclyffe
   deed was turned over to [409]George Boldt, proprietor of the
   Waldorf-Astoria, to pay a US$20,000 debt. In 1917, around the time that
   the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more
   viable real estate asset, Tesla received [410]AIEE's highest honor, the
   [411]Edison Medal.

   Tesla, in August 1917, first established principles regarding frequency
   and power level for the first primitive [412]radar units.^[413][74]

   In 1934, [414]Émile Girardeau, working with the first French radar
   systems, stated he was building them "according to the principles
   stated by Tesla". By the 1920s, Tesla was reportedly negotiating with
   the United Kingdom government about a ray system. Tesla had also stated
   that efforts had been made to steal the so called "death ray". It is
   suggested that the removal of the [415]Chamberlain government ended
   negotiations.

   On Tesla's 75th birthday in 1931, [416]Time magazine put him on its
   cover. The cover caption noted his contribution to [417]electrical
   power generation. Tesla received his last patent in 1928 for an
   apparatus for [418]aerial transportation which was the first instance
   of [419]VTOL [420]aircraft. By the end of 1931, Tesla released "On
   Future Motive Power" which covered an [421]ocean thermal energy
   conversion system. In 1934, Tesla wrote to consul Janković of his
   homeland. The letter contained a message of gratitude to [422]Mihajlo
   Pupin who had initiated a donation scheme by which American companies
   could support Tesla. Tesla refused the assistance, choosing instead to
   live on a modest pension received from Yugoslavia, and to continue his
   research.

   In 1936, Tesla wrote in a telegram to [423]Vladko Maček: "I'm equally
   proud of my Serbian origin and my Croatian homeland. Long live all
   Yugoslavs."

Field theories

   When he was 81, Tesla stated he had completed a "dynamic theory of
   gravity". He stated that it was "worked out in all details" and that he
   hoped to soon give it to the world.^[424][75] The theory was never
   published.

   The bulk of the theory was developed between 1892 and 1894, during the
   period that he was conducting experiments with high frequency and high
   [425]potential electromagnetism and patenting devices for their use.
   Reminiscent of [426]Mach's principle, Tesla stated in 1925 that:
   Nikola Tesla, with [427]Ruđer Bošković's book Theoria Philosophiae
   Naturalis, sits in front of the spiral coil of his high-frequency
   transformer at East Houston Street, New York.

     There is no thing endowed with life—from man, who is enslaving the
     elements, to the nimblest creature—in all this world that does not
     sway in its turn. Whenever action is born from force, though it be
     infinitesimal, the cosmic balance is upset and the universal motion
     results.

   Tesla was critical of Einstein's relativity work, calling it:

     ...[a] magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and
     makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a
     beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king ...
     its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather
     than scientists ...^[428][76]

   Tesla also argued:

     I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it
     can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has
     properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own
     making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter
     filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space
     becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon
     nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.^[429][77]

   Tesla also believed that much of [430]Albert Einstein's [431]relativity
   theory had already been proposed by [432]Ruđer Bošković, stating in an
   unpublished interview:

     ...the relativity theory, by the way, is much older than its present
     proponents. It was advanced over 200 years ago by my illustrious
     countryman Ruđer Bošković, the great philosopher, who, not
     withstanding other and multifold obligations, wrote a thousand
     volumes of excellent literature on a vast variety of subjects.
     Bošković dealt with relativity, including the so-called time-space
     continuum ...'.^[433][78]

Directed-energy weapon

   Later in life, Tesla made remarkable claims concerning a
   "[434]teleforce" weapon.^[435][79] The press called it a "peace ray" or
   [436]death ray.^[437][80]^[438][81] In total, the components and
   methods included:^[439][82]^[440][83]
     * An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air
       instead of in a [441]high vacuum as in the past. This, according to
       Tesla in 1934, was accomplished.
     * A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force. This,
       according to Tesla, was also accomplished.
     * A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the
       second mechanism.
     * A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force.
       This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.

   Tesla worked on plans for a [442]directed-energy weapon from the early
   1900s until his death. In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise entitled "The
   Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the
   Natural Media", which concerned [443]charged particle beams.^[444][84]
   Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical
   description of a "[445]superweapon that would put an end to all war."
   This treatise describing the [446]particle beam is currently in the
   [447]Nikola Tesla Museum archive in [448]Belgrade. It describes an
   open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to
   exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method
   of creating and directing nondispersive particle streams (through
   [449]electrostatic repulsion).^[450][84]

   His records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of
   [451]atomic clusters of liquid [452]mercury or [453]tungsten
   accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his [454]magnifying
   transformer). Tesla gives the following description concerning the
   [455]particle gun's operation:

     [The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the
     free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a
     fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a
     defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in
     their tracks.^[456][85]

   The weapon could be used against ground based infantry or for
   antiaircraft purposes.^[457][86] Tesla tried to interest the [458]US
   War Department in the device.^[459][87] He also offered this invention
   to European countries.^[460][88] None of the governments purchased a
   contract to build the device. He was unable to act on his
   plans.^[461][89]

Theoretical inventions

   Another of Tesla's theorized inventions is commonly referred to as
   Tesla's Flying Machine, which appears to resemble an [462]ion-propelled
   aircraft.^[463][90] Tesla claimed that one of his life goals was to
   create a flying machine that would run without the use of an airplane
   engine, wings, [464]ailerons, [465]propellers, or an onboard fuel
   source. Initially, Tesla pondered about the idea of a flying craft that
   would fly using an electric motor powered by grounded base stations. As
   time progressed, Tesla suggested that perhaps such an aircraft could be
   run entirely electro-mechanically. The theorized appearance would
   typically take the form of a cigar or saucer.^[466][91]

Personal life

   Tesla's father Milutin Tesla

   Tesla was fluent in eight languages. Along with [467]Serbian, he spoke
   [468]Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and
   [469]Latin.^[470][92]

   Tesla may have suffered from [471]obsessive-compulsive disorder, and
   had many unusual quirks and [472]phobias. He did things in threes, and
   was adamant about staying in a hotel room with a number divisible by
   three. Tesla was physically revolted by jewelry, notably pearl
   earrings.^[473][93] He was fastidious about cleanliness and hygiene,
   and was by all accounts [474]mysophobic.

   Tesla was obsessed with pigeons, ordering special seeds for the pigeons
   he fed in [475]Central Park and even bringing injured ones into his
   hotel room to nurse them back to health. Tesla was an animal-lover,
   often reflecting contentedly about a childhood cat, "The Magnificent
   Mačak." Tesla never married. He was [476]celibate and claimed that his
   chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.^[477][20]
   Nonetheless there have been numerous accounts of women vying for
   Tesla's affection, even some madly in love with him. Tesla, though
   polite, behaved rather ambivalently to these women in the romantic
   sense.

   Tesla was prone to alienating himself and was generally soft-spoken.
   However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very
   positively and admiringly of him. Robert Underwood Johnson described
   him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty,
   refinement, generosity, and force." His loyal secretary, Dorothy
   Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always
   denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his
   soul." Tesla's friend Hawthorne wrote that "seldom did one meet a
   scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an
   appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and
   drink."

   Nevertheless, Tesla displayed the occasional cruel streak; he openly
   expressed his disgust for overweight people, once firing a secretary
   because of her weight.^[478][94] He was quick to criticize others'
   clothing as well, on several occasions directing a subordinate to go
   home and change her dress.^[479][20]

   Tesla was widely known for his great showmanship, presenting his
   innovations and demonstrations to the public as an artform, almost like
   a magician. This seems to conflict with his observed reclusiveness;
   Tesla was a complicated figure. He refused to hold conventions without
   his Tesla coil blasting electricity throughout the room, despite the
   audience often being terrified, though he assured them everything was
   perfectly safe.
   [480]Mark Twain in Tesla's lab, early 1894

   In middle age, Tesla became close friends with [481]Mark Twain. They
   spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.

   Tesla remained bitter in the aftermath of his dispute with Edison. The
   day after Edison died the [482]New York Times contained extensive
   coverage of Edison's life, with the only negative opinion coming from
   Tesla, who was quoted as saying:

   He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived
   in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene  ... His
   method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be
   covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at
   first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a
   little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the
   labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and
   mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's
   instinct and practical American sense.^[483][95]

   Shortly before he died, Edison said that his biggest mistake had been
   in trying to develop direct current, rather than the superior
   alternating current system that Tesla had put within his
   grasp.^[484][96]

   Tesla was good friends with [485]Robert Underwood Johnson. He had
   amicable relations with [486]Francis Marion Crawford, [487]Stanford
   White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. He ripped
   up a [488]Westinghouse contract that would have made him the world's
   first billionaire, in part because of the implications it would have on
   his future vision of free power, and in part because it would run
   Westinghouse out of business, and Tesla had no desire to deal with the
   creditors.

   Tesla lived the last ten years of his life in a two-room suite on the
   33rd floor of the [489]Hotel New Yorker, room 3327. There, near the end
   of his life, Tesla showed signs of encroaching senility, claiming to be
   visited by a specific white pigeon daily. Several biographers note that
   Tesla viewed the death of the pigeon as a "final blow" to himself and
   his work.

   Tesla believed that war could not be avoided until the cause for its
   recurrence was removed, but was opposed to wars in general. However,
   Tesla came to find exceptions in which he thought certain situations
   and wars were justifiable.^[490][97] Tesla sought to reduce distance,
   such as in communication for better understanding, transportation, and
   transmission of energy, as a means to ensure friendly
   [491]international relations.^[492][98]

   Tesla was a life-long bachelor. Like many of his era, he became a
   proponent of a self-imposed [493]selective breeding version of
   [494]eugenics. In a 1937 interview, he stated:

   ... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless
   workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of
   civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by
   sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ....
   The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more
   difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be
   permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur
   to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to
   marry a habitual criminal.^[495][99]

   In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of
   women and the struggle of women toward [496]gender equality, indicated
   that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees". He believed that
   women would become the dominant sex in the future.^[497][100]

   In his later years Tesla became a vegetarian. In an article for
   [498]Century Illustrated Magazine he wrote: "It is certainly preferable
   to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that vegetarianism is a
   commendable departure from the established barbarous habit." Tesla
   argued that it is wrong to eat uneconomic meat when large numbers of
   people are starving; he also believed that plant food was "superior to
   [meat] in regard to both mechanical and mental performance". He also
   argued that animal slaughter was "wanton and cruel".^[499][101]

   In his final years he suffered from extreme sensitivity to light, sound
   and other influences.^[500][102]

Death

   Urn with Tesla's ashes, [501]Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade

   Tesla died of [502]heart failure alone in room 3327 of the [503]New
   Yorker Hotel, on 7 January 1943.^[504][103] Despite having sold his AC
   electricity patents, Tesla died with significant debts. Later that year
   the [505]US Supreme Court upheld Tesla's patent number 645576 in a
   ruling that served as the basis for patented radio technology in the
   United States.^[506][104]

   Tesla's funeral took place on 12 January 1943, at the [507]Cathedral of
   Saint John the Divine in [508]Manhattan, New York City.^[509][105] His
   body was cremated and his ashes taken to Belgrade, Serbia,
   then-[510]Yugoslavia in 1957. The urn was placed in the [511]Nikola
   Tesla Museum in Belgrade.
   Bust of Tesla by [512]Ivan Meštrović, 1952, in [513]Zagreb, Croatia

   Soon after his death Tesla's safe was opened by his nephew Sava
   Kosanović. Shortly thereafter Tesla's papers and other property were
   impounded by the United States' [514]Alien Property Custodian office in
   Tesla's compound at the Manhattan Warehouse, even though he was a
   [515]naturalized citizen.

   Dr. John G. Trump was the main government official who went over
   Tesla's secret papers after his death in 1943. At the time, Trump was a
   well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the
   National Defense Research Committee of the Office of Scientific
   Research & Development, Technical Aids, Div. 14, NTRC (predecessor
   agency to the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence). Trump was also
   a professor at M.I.T., and had his feelings hurt by Tesla's 1938 review
   and critique of M.I.T.'s huge Van de Graaff generator with its two
   thirty-foot towers and two 15-foot-diameter (4.6 m) balls, mounted on
   railroad tracks—which Tesla showed could be out-performed in both
   voltage and current by one of his tiny coils about two feet
   tall.^[516][106] Trump was asked to participate in the examination of
   Tesla's papers at the Manhattan Warehouse & Storage Co. Trump reported
   afterwards that no examination had been made of the vast amount of
   Tesla's property, that had been in the basement of the New Yorker
   Hotel, ten years prior to Tesla's death, or of any of his papers,
   except those in his immediate possession at the time of his death.
   Trump concluded in his report, that there was nothing that would
   constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands.

   At the time of his death, Tesla had been working on the [517]Teleforce
   weapon, or 'death ray,' that he had unsuccessfully marketed to the US
   War Department. It appears that Teleforce was related to his research
   into [518]ball lightning and [519]plasma, and was conceived as a
   [520]particle beam weapon. The US government did not find a prototype
   of the device in the safe.

   After the FBI was contacted by the War Department, his papers were
   declared to be [521]top secret. The personal effects were sequestered
   on the advice of presidential advisers; [522]J. Edgar Hoover declared
   the case most secret, because of the nature of Tesla's inventions and
   patents.^[523][107] One document stated that "[he] is reported to have
   some 80 trunks in different places containing transcripts and plans
   having to do with his experiments [...]". Altogether, in Tesla's
   effects, there were the contents of his safe, two truckloads of papers
   and apparati from his hotel, another 75 packing crates and trunks in a
   storage facility, and another 80 large storage trunks in another
   storage facility. The Navy and several "federal officials" spent two
   days microfilming some of the stuff at the Office of Alien Properties
   storage facility in 1943, and that was it, until Oct., 1945.^[524][108]

   Tesla's family and the Yugoslav embassy struggled with the American
   authorities to gain these items after his death because of the
   potential significance of some of his research. Eventually Mr.
   Kosanović won possession of the materials, which are now housed in the
   [525]Nikola Tesla Museum.^[526][109]

Monuments

   A monument to Tesla was established at [549]Niagara Falls, New York.
   This monument, portraying Tesla reading a set of notes, is a copy of a
   monument standing in front of the [550]University of Belgrade Faculty
   of Electrical Engineering. Another monument to Tesla, featuring him
   standing on a portion of an alternator, was established at [551]Queen
   Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, [552]Ontario, Canada. The monument was
   officially unveiled on 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's
   birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church,
   [553]Niagara Falls, and designed by Les Drysdale of [554]Hamilton,
   Ontario. Drysdale's design was the winning design from an international
   competition.

   In 1994, acting on the advice of the President's Advisory Council on
   Historic Preservation, a formal nomination process was initiated by the
   [555]Tesla Wardenclyffe Project seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe
   laboratory-office building and the Tesla tower foundation on both the
   New York State and National Registers of Historic Places. This would
   result in the creation of a monument to Tesla out of the Wardenclyffe
   site itself.^[556][117]

Portrayals in popular culture

   Main article: [557]Nikola Tesla in popular culture

   Nikola Tesla has appeared in popular culture as a character in books,
   films, radio, TV, music, live theatre, comics and video games. The lack
   of recognition received by Tesla during his own lifetime has made him a
   tragic and inspirational character well suited to dramatic fiction. The
   impact of the technologies invented by Tesla is a recurring theme in
   several types of science fiction. His work also featured in
   [558]Bethesda Softworks game [559]Fallout 3.

Filmography

   See also: [920]Nikola Tesla in popular culture
     * There are at least two films describing Tesla's life. In the first,
       filmed in 1977, arranged for TV, Tesla was portrayed by [921]Rade
       Šerbedžija. In 1980, [922]Orson Welles produced a [923]Yugoslav
       film named [924]Tajna Nikole Tesle (The Secret of Nikola Tesla), in
       which Welles himself played the part of Tesla's patron, [925]J.P.
       Morgan. The film was directed by [926]Krsto Papić, and Nikola Tesla
       was portrayed by [927]Petar Božović.
     * "[928]Tesla: Master of Lightning". 1999. ISBN (Book) ISBN (PBS
       Video)
     * [929]Lost Lightning: The Missing Secrets of Nikola Tesla (at Google
       Video.) Tesla's designs for free energy and defensive weapons
       systems.
     * [930]David Bowie portrayed Tesla in the 2006 film [931]The
       Prestige. Tesla's time in Colorado Springs was the focus of several
       scenes in the film, which featured speculations on the explosive
       power of Tesla's electrical experiments.
     * [932]Tesla: Master of Lightning, produced by Robert Uth for New
       Voyage Communications in 2003, tapped [933]Stacy Keach to supply
       the voice of Tesla.
