    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Alexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was an eminent scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone. Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876. In retrospect, Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study. Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils and aeronautics. In 1888, Alexander Graham Bell became one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikola_Tesla">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was an inventor and a mechanical and electrical engineer. He was one of the most important contributors to the birth of commercial electricity, and is best known for his many revolutionary developments in the field of electromagnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tesla's patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current (AC) electric power systems, including the polyphase system of electrical distribution and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution. Born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, Croatian Military Frontier in Austrian Empire, he was a subject of the Austrian Empire by birth and later became an American citizen. After his demonstration of wireless communication through radio in 1894 and after being the victor in the "War of Currents", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers who worked in America. Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. During this period, in the United States, Tesla's fame rivaled that of any other inventor or scientist in history or popular culture, but because of his eccentric personality and his seemingly unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately ostracized and regarded as a mad scientist. Tesla never put much focus on his finances and died impoverished at the age of 86. The International System of Units unit measuring magnetic field B (also referred to as the magnetic flux density and magnetic induction), the tesla, was named in his honor (at the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures, Paris, 1960), as well as the Tesla effect of wireless energy transfer to wirelessly power electronic devices (which Tesla demonstrated on a low scale with incandescent light bulbs as early as 1893 and aspired to use for the intercontinental transmission of industrial power levels in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project). Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering, Tesla contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics, remote control, radar, and computer science, and to the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. A few of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism.</dbo:abstract>

Westinghouse was one of Thomas Edison's main rivals in the early implementation of the American electricity system. Westinghouse's system, which used alternating current based on the extensive research by Nikola Tesla, ultimately prevailed over Edison's insistence on direct current. In 1911, he received the AIEE's Edison Medal 'For meritorious achievement in connection with the development of the alternating current system light.

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Charles Augustus Lindbergh (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974) (nicknamed "Slim," "Lucky Lindy" and "The Lone Eagle") was an American aviator, author, inventor and explorer. Lindbergh, then a 25-year old U.S. Air Mail pilot, emerged from virtual obscurity to almost instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, from Roosevelt Field located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles, in the single-seat, single-engine monoplane Spirit of St. Louis. Lindbergh, a U.S. Army reserve officer, was also awarded the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his historic exploit. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lindbergh relentlessly used his fame to help promote the rapid development of U.S. commercial aviation. In March 1932, however, his infant son, Charles, Jr. , was kidnapped and murdered in what was soon dubbed the "Crime of the Century" which eventually led to the Lindbergh family fleeing the United States in December 1935 to live in Europe where they remained up until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Before the United States entered World War II in December, 1941, Lindbergh had been an outspoken advocate of keeping the U.S. out of the world conflict (as was his Congressman father Charles August Lindbergh during World War I) and became a leader of the anti-war America First movement. Nonetheless, he supported the war effort after Pearl Harbor and flew many combat missions in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a civilian consultant, even though President Roosevelt had refused to reinstate his Army Air Corps colonel's commission that he had resigned earlier in 1939. In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific prize-winning author, international explorer, inventor, and active environmentalist.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Oliver Evans (13 September 1755 &amp;ndash; 15 April 1819) was an American inventor. Evans was born in Newport, Delaware to a family of Welsh settlers. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Evans' first invention was in 1777, when he designed a machine for making card teeth for carding wool. He went into business with his brothers and produced a number of improvements in the textile industry. His most important invention was an automated grist mill which operated continuously through the use of bulk material handling devices including bucket elevators, conveyor belts, and Archimedean screws. Evans described this invention in The Young Mill-wright and Millers' Guide. He patented this invention in a few states and, when the US patent system was established, in the federal patent system. Evans devoted a great deal of his time to patents, patent extensions, and enforcement of his patents. In 1792 he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He produced an improved high-pressure steam engine — his second most important invention. For some years he contemplated the idea of applying steam power to wagons. He was granted a patent for a steam-carriage design in 1789, but did not produce a working example of such a machine until over a decade later. (See below on his Oruktor Amphibolos). Part of his difficulties was a failure to get financial backing. After lack of support in his native land, in 1794 he sent copies of some his designs to Great Britain in an attempt to interest investors there. As Evans designed a refrigeration machine which ran on vapor in 1805, he is often called the inventor of the refrigerator, although he never built one. (His design was modified by Jacob Perkins, who obtained the first patent for a refrigerating machine in 1834).</dbo:abstract>

Evinrude was born in Norway and at the age of five emigrated with his family to the United States, settling in Cambridge, Wisconsin. At age sixteen he went to Madison, where he worked in machinery stores and studied engineering on his own. He became a machinist while working at various machine tool firms in Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. In 1900, Evinrude co-founded the custom engine firm Clemick &amp;amp; Evinrude. In 1907, he invented the first practical and reliable outboard motor, which was built of steel and brass, and had a crank on the flywheel to start the two-cycle engine. Evinrude reported that his invention was inspired by rowing a boat on a small lake outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin on a hot day to get ice cream for his girlfriend, Bess. By 1912, the firm employed 300 workers. Evinrude let two motorcycle mad teens tinker in his Milwaukee based machine shop; one was named Arthur Davidson who went on to Harley-Davidson motorcycle fame, also based in Milwaukee. Ole Evinrude formed Evinrude Outboard Motors, which he sold in 1913 in order to look after his sick wife. In 1919, Evinrude invented a more efficient and lighter two-cylinder motor. Having sold his part in Clemick &amp;amp; Evinrude, he founded ELTO or the Elto Outboard Motor Company. (ELTO was an acronym for "Evinrude Light Twin Outboard". ) Although Elto faced stiff competition from other companies, such as Johnson Motor Company of South Bend, Indiana, Evinrude's company survived through acquisitions, eventually forming the Outboard Marine Corporation. After Evinrude died in 1934, soon after the death of his wife, his son, Ralph Evinrude, took over day-to-day management of the company, eventually rising to Chairman of the Board.</dbo:abstract>

He earned a BS chemistry from St. Louis University in 1963, his Ph.D. in Nuclear Chemistry from Washington University in St. Louis in 1970 and completed postgraduate work in nuclear chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1972 he joined the faculty of Washington University’s School of Medicine, where he and Dr. Michael Phelps began developing what later became known as the PET scanner, used to detect cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses. In 1975, Phelps and Hoffman moved to the University of Pennsylvania. Starting in 1976, Hoffman was a professor at UCLA medical school in the Departments of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology and Radiological Sciences. In 1999, he authored a book that reviews the biochemical basis of alternative medical treatments for cancer. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the journal IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science. He died of liver cancer in Los Angeles, California.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Lewis Miller (July 24, 1829 &amp;ndash; February 17, 1899) was an Ohio businessman and philanthropist who made a fortune in the late 19th century as inventor of the first combine (harvester-reaper machine) with the blade mounted efficiently in front of the the driver, to the side of the horse(s), rather than pulled behind. His daughter Mina (1866-1947) married fellow Ohio inventor Thomas Alva Edison on Christmas Day 1886. Miller was born in Greentown, Ohio. He devoted much of his wealth to public service and to charitable causes associated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was the inventor of the "Akron Plan" for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, a configuration Miller conceived with Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent and architect Jacob Snyder. The arrangement accommodated 1) a collective opening exercise for all the children; 2) small radiating classrooms for graded instruction in the uniform lesson of the day; and 3) a general closing exercise in the central assembly area. In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the "Uniform Lesson Plan" he had developed with Vincent, the two worked together again to found what is now the Chautauqua Institution on the shores of Chautauqua Lake, New York. Miller died in 1899 of Kidney disease and was buried in Glendale Cemetery in Akron, Ohio.</dbo:abstract>

Young was the designer of Bell Helicopter's first helicopter, the Model 30, and inventor of the stabilizer bar used on many of Bell's early helicopter designs. He founded the "Institute for the Study of Consciousness" in Berkeley in 1972. Young advocated a process theory, which is a form of integral theory. These theories attempt to integrate the realm of human thought and experience with the realm of science so that the concept of universe is not limited to that which can be physically measured. Young's theory embraces evolution and the concept of the great chain of being. He has influenced such thinkers as Stanislav Grof.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Paul Kollsman (February 22, 1900 in Germany &amp;ndash; March 17, 1982 in Beverly Hills, California) was an American inventor. He invented barometers and instruments for instrument flight in airplanes. Kollsman studied civil engineering in Stuttgart and Munich. In 1923 he emigrated from Germany to the USA. He worked as truck-driver until he found a position at Pioneer Instruments Co. in Brooklyn/New York. In 1928 he founded his own company, Kollsman Instruments Co. , with $500 of seed money. He was searching for the right opportunity to launch his product a long time until Jimmy Doolittle flight tested his instruments. His instruments were later used in the NASA Apollo program. The altimeter setting window of the sensitive aircraft altimeter is named the "Kollsman Window" after him. In 1939, Kollsman, who was then residing in Greenwich, Conn. , sold his company for more than $4,000,000. In 1940 he purchased 800 acres (3.2 km) of land outside of Manchester Vermont from International Paper Company, and founded Snow Valley, which formally opened in January 1942, and was one of the earliest ski areas in the United States. Snow Valley operated continuously until 1984, and in 1983 hosted the first U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships (now held annually at Stratton Vermont). Snow Valley is being redeveloped as a private sporting community. In 1944 Kollsman married Baroness Julie Dorothea Baronin von Bodenhausen in New York City. In 1945 Kollsman purchased The Enchanted Hill, a fabulous estate in Beverly Hills, California, which contained a Mediterranean Revival main house of 10,000 square feet (with twelve acres of formal gardens) which Mr. Kollsman eventually augumented to 120 acres, designed by acclaimed architect Wallace Neff. The estate, which was described by architectural historian Sam Watters as “fantastical”, had been built in 1925 at the top of Angelo Drive by MGM screenwriter Frances Marion and her cowboy-star husband, Frederick Clifton Thomson. Among other features, the estate included a mahogany-floored stable for Thomson’s horse "Silver King". It was considered one of the finest estates in all of Los Angeles, and has been called a “poetic hilltop paradise, a timeless homage to the natural beauty that was once Los Angeles. ” Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen acquired the estate from Kollsman’s widow in 1997 for $20 million, and, in what can only be described as an act of culutural vandalism, razed the landmark house in 2000, and has plans to build two (convert|50000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansions in its place. Kollsman died in Beverly Hills, California in 1982.

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Joseph Slepian (February 11, 1891 &amp;ndash; December 19, 1969) was an American electrical engineer known for his contributions to the developments of electrical apparatus and theory. Born in Boston, MA of Jewish Russian immigrants, he studied mathematics at Harvard University, from which he was awarded a B. Sc. (1911), a M. Sc. (1912) and Ph.D. on the thesis On the Functions of a Complex Variable Defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation of the First Order and First Degree advised by George Birkhoff (1913). Meanwhile he also worked at Boston Elevated Railway. After his Ph.D. , he became Sheldon fellow at University of Göttingen in Germany, was at University of Sorbonne in Paris, before becoming instructor of mathematics at Cornell University (1915). He joined Westinghouse Electric in East Pittsburgh (1916) in the railway motor department initially, moving to the research department (1917) at Forest Hills (PA) where he became head (1922), consulting engineer (1926) and associate director (1938&amp;ndash;1956) and developed over two hundred patents. Slepian did significant groundwork for the betatron (1927). He received the IEEE Edison Medal (1947) for his work on the autovalve lightning arrester, deion circuit breaker, and ignitron. He wrote over 120 articles and essays, and published the book Conductivity of electricity in gases (1933). His career was somewhat shortened by a stroke (1951).

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Weatherby">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Roy E. Weatherby was the founder and owner of Weatherby, Inc. , an American rifle, shotgun and cartridge manufacturing company set up in 1945. He grew up on a farm in Kansas. He later moved to Huntington Park, California where he and his wife, Camela, bought a Spanish style home located on 7672 California Street on the corner of Grand Avenue. Weatherby started manufacturing Weatherby Guns in his garage at the Huntington Park home. As orders for his guns increased, and social appointment pressed him and his wife to be away from home, his daughter, Diane, was often cared for by the neighbor lady, Emma Jones. Weatherby firearms are best known for their very high-powered rifle cartridges, all bearing the name Weatherby Magnum such as the .257 Weatherby Magnum and the .460 Weatherby Magnum, and for the production of appropriately-chambered sporting rifles. Weatherby came into the world of commercial cartridge and rifle making with a background of experimentation in cartridge wildcatting and was determined to develop a range of sporting rifle cartridges that would produce very high muzzle velocities, high bullet energies, very flat trajectories, and very hard-hitting characteristics at long range. Among those who influenced his thinking and products was the English riflemaker and cartridge designer David Lloyd. Following the considerable commercial success of Weatherby Inc. , Roy Weatherby established the Weatherby Foundation (initially known as the Roy E. Weatherby Foundation) as a non-profit, tax-exempt Foundation to educate the non-hunting public about the beneficial role of ethical sporting hunting, especially its contributions to wildlife conservation. It currently leads a national initiative to foster the development of educational outdoor expositions, and as at 2007 has sponsored 78 events in 19 of the US states, with combined attendance figures of nearly 1 million. The Foundation annually sponsors the prestigious Weatherby Hunting &amp;amp; Conservation Award.</dbo:abstract>

After graduating from the University of Kansas with a B.S. degree in engineering in 1940, he went to work as a research engineer for The Dow Chemical Company. During World War II, when rubber was in short supply, McIntire’s work focused on developing a rubber-like substance that could be used as a flexible insulator. In an experiment in which he combined styrene with isobutylene, he created a unique material that was solid yet flexible due to the tiny bubbles formed by isobutylene within the styrene. McIntire had invented foam polystyrene, more commonly known by its brand name, Styrofoam, that was 30 times lighter and more flexible than solid polystyrene. It was also inexpensive and moisture resistant. McIntire remained at The Dow Chemical Company for his entire career. He was promoted to research director, and later worked in the company’s consumer and venture capital divisions. He retired in 1981 as Dow’s director of technology and acquisition. In March 2008, McIntire was inducted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</dbo:abstract>

He is most well known for his invention, perfection, and popularization of the Crompton Loom, a fancy loom that could reach maximum speeds of eighty-five picks per second, nearly twice the speed of its most efficient predecessors. Crompton Loom Works, located in his hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts, aided in the Civil War effort to provide uniforms and blankets for the U.S. Army. Crompton’s looms did have competition from foreign innovations, yet when brought to the Paris Exposition Universelle (1867) his products won a silver medal. His looms were also present at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. From these two events, the Crompton Loom gained popularity and became famous throughout the manufacturing circle. Crompton was also quite involved in his town of Worcester; he was a member of the common council (1860-1861) and held the office of alderman (1863-1864), in addition to running for mayor unsuccessfully in 1871. When he died, the community of Worcester, Massachusetts announced that it had lost the man who helped the town transform from a “pretty New England town” to an industrial city. Crompton was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007 due to the large-scale impact of his loom.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Washington_Carver">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">George Washington Carver (January 1864 – January 5, 1943), was an American scientist, botanist, educator and inventor. The exact day and year of his birth are unknown; he is believed to have been born before slavery was abolished in Missouri in January 1864. Much of Carver's fame is based on his research into and promotion of alternative crops to cotton, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes that used peanuts. He also created or disseminated about 100 products made from peanuts that were useful for the house and farm, including cosmetics, dyes, paints, plastics, gasoline, and nitroglycerin. In the Reconstruction South, an agricultural monoculture of cotton depleted the soil, and in the early 20th century the boll weevil destroyed much of the cotton crop. Carver's work on peanuts was intended to provide an alternative crop. In addition to his work on agricultural extension education for purposes of advocacy of sustainable agriculture and appreciation of plants and nature, Carver's important accomplishments also included improvement of racial relations, mentoring children, poetry, painting, and religion. He served as an example of the importance of hard work, a positive attitude, and a good education. His humility, humanitarianism, good nature, frugality, and rejection of economic materialism also have been admired widely. One of his most important roles was in undermining, through the fame of his achievements and many talents, the widespread stereotype of the time that the black race was intellectually inferior to the white race. In 1941, Time magazine dubbed him a "Black Leonardo", a reference to the Renaissance Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci. To commemorate his life and inventions, George Washington Carver Recognition Day is celebrated on January 5, the anniversary of Carver's death.</dbo:abstract>

Beauregard was trained as a civil engineer at the United States Military Academy and served with distinction as an engineer in the Mexican-American War. Following an extremely brief tenure as the superintendent of the Military Academy in 1861, he became the first Confederate brigadier general and commanded the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, for the start of the Civil War at Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Three months later he was the victor at the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia. Beauregard commanded armies in the Western Theater, including at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, and the Siege of Corinth in northern Mississippi. He returned to Charleston and defended it from repeated naval and land attacks in 1863. His arguably greatest achievement was saving the city of Petersburg, Virginia, and thus also the Confederate capital of Richmond, from assaults by overwhelmingly superior Union Army forces in June 1864. However, his influence over Confederate strategy was marred by his poor professional relationships with President Jefferson Davis and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis and the remaining cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered most of the remaining armies of the Confederacy to Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, including Beauregard and his men. Following his military career, Beauregard served as a railroad executive and became one of the few wealthy Confederate veterans because of his role in promoting the Louisiana Lottery. Today he is commonly referred to as P.G.T. Beauregard, but during the war he rarely used his first name and signed correspondence as G.T. Beauregard.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Harold Stephen Black (April 14, 1898 – December 11, 1983) was an American electrical engineer, who revolutionized the field of applied electronics by inventing the negative feedback amplifier in 1927. To some, his invention is considered the most important breakthrough of the twentieth century in the field of electronics, since it has a wide area of application. This is because all electronic devices (vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors and MOS transistors) invented by mankind are basically nonlinear devices. It is the invention of negative feedback which makes highly linear amplifiers possible. Negative feedback basically works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity (or in other words, smaller distortion or smaller intermodulation). By sacrificing gain, it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier. However, a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate. Once the stability problem is solved, the negative feedback amplifier is extremely useful in the field of electronics. Black published a famous paper, Stabilized feedback amplifiers, in 1934.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Jordan_Gatling">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling (September 12, 1818 &amp;ndash; February 26, 1903) was an American inventor best known for his invention of the Gatling gun, the first successful machine gun. The son of farmer and inventor Jordan Gatling, Gatling was born in the town of Como, North Carolina in Hertford County and by the age of 21 had invented the screw propeller for steamboats, only to discover it had recently and independently been patented by John Ericsson. He worked as a fisherman, court clerk, teacher, and storekeeper. While running his own store, he invented a wheat drill, a planting device, and manufactured these for sale. By 1845 he was earning enough from this device to devote himself to selling and marketing it full-time. Gatling graduated from Ohio Medical College in 1850 but was more interested in continuing his career as an inventor than in practicing medicine. By the early 1850s he was successful enough in business to offer marriage to Jemima Sanders, 19 years his junior and the daughter of a prominent Indianapolis physician. They married on 25 October 1854. Her younger sister Zerelda was married to David Wallace, the governor of Indiana. Gatling invented the Gatling gun after he noticed early in the American Civil War that a majority of the dead were lost to disease rather than gunshots. In 1857, he wrote: "It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine - a gun - which could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and disease [would] be greatly diminished. " Although Gatling was accused of being a copperhead because of his North Carolina roots, it was never proven; Gatling was never affiliated with the Confederate States government or military, nor did he live in the South during the Civil War. After developing and demonstrating a working prototype,in 1862 he founded the Gatling Gun Company in Indianapolis, Indiana to market the gun. The first 6 production guns were destroyed during a fire in December 1862 at the factory where they had been manufactured at Gatling's expense. Undaunted, Gatling arranged for another 13 to be manufactured at the Cincinnati Type Factory. While General Benjamin F. Butler bought 12 and Admiral David Dixon Porter bought one it wasn‘t until 1866 that the US Government officially purchased Gatling guns. In 1870 he sold his patents for the Gatling gun to Colt. Gatling remained president of the Gatling Gun Company until it was fully absorbed by Colt in 1897. The hand-cranked Gatling gun was declared obsolete by the United States Army in 1911. In his later years, Gatling patented inventions to improve toilets, bicycles, steam-cleaning of raw wool, pneumatic power, and many other fields. World-famous, he was elected as the first president of the American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers in 1891, serving for six years. Although still quite wealthy at the time of his death, he had made and lost several fortunes in bad investments. In his last years, Gatling moved to St. Louis, Missouri to form a new company for manufacturing his steam plows, or tractors. While in New York City to visit his daughter and to talk with his patent agency, Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling died at his daughter's home on February 26, 1903. He is interred at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.</dbo:abstract>

Two years later, he also started the Dow Gardens in Midland, Michigan as a personal hobby. H.H. Dow High School in Midland, Michigan, is named after Dow. Among his awards is the Perkin Medal, received in 1930.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hudson_Maxim">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Hudson Maxim (February 3, 1853 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1927), was a U.S. inventor and chemist who invented a variety of explosives, including smokeless gunpowder. He was the brother of Hiram Stevens Maxim, inventor of the Maxim gun and uncle of Hiram Percy Maxim, inventor of the Maxim Silencer. Maxim was a man of many talents. He started his career in 1881 as the publisher of Real Pen Work - Self Instructor in Penmanship, a book addressing the arts of calligraphy and penmanship, and the sale of special inks, pens, and other supplies related to penmanship. Later he joined his brother Hiram Stevens Maxim's workshop in the United Kingdom, where they both worked on the improvement of smokeless gunpowder. After some disputes, Hudson Maxim returned to the USA and developed a number of stable high explosives, the rights of which were sold to the DuPont company. During World War I Maxim wrote a book "Defenseless America", in which he pointed out the inferiority of the American defence system and the vulnerability of the country against attacks of foreign aggressors. His good friend, Elbert Hubbard, died on the RMS Lusitania when it was torpedoed by a German submarine. This event fueled his belief that the USA should improve its defenses and join the war against Germany on the side of the Entente. Maxim also wrote the book "The Science of Poetry and the Philosophy of Language" about the nature and writing of poetry. In this work he contended that words, like chemical particles, had natural laws that governed the manner in which they could be combined into verse, and that poetry perceived as excellent was in fact one that conformed to those laws. He also argued that certain famous poets had discovered those laws and put them to use in their poetry. During his experimental career, he lost his left hand in a mercury fulminate explosion in 1912. Hudson lived out his latter years at his estate on the shores of Lake Hopatcong New Jersey. He was a great promoter and supporter of the development of Lake Hopatcong and the Borough of Hopatcong and is honored by a memorial in Lake Hopatcong State Park. He was an important member of the College of Fellows of the Academy of Nations.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Stanford R. Ovshinsky (born November 24, 1922, in Akron, Ohio) is an American inventor and scientist who has been granted approximately 400 patents over the last fifty years, mostly in the areas of energy or information. Many of his inventions have had wide ranging applications. Among the most prominent are: an environmentally friendly nickel-metal hydride battery, which has been widely used in laptop computers, digital cameras, cell phones, and electric and hybrid cars; continuous web multi-junction flexible thin-film solar energy laminates and panels; flat screen liquid crystal displays; rewritable CD and DVD computer memories; hydrogen fuel cells; and nonvolatile phase-change electronic memories. Ovshinsky opened the scientific field of amorphous and disordered materials in the course of his research in the 1940s and 50s in neurophysiology, neural disease, the nature of intelligence in mammals and machines, and cybernetics. Amorphous silicon semiconductors have become the basis of many technologies and industries. Ovshinsky is also distinguished in being self-taught, without formal college or graduate training. Throughout his life, his love for science and his social convictions were the primary engines for his inventive work. In 1960 Ovshinsky and his soon-to-be second wife, Iris Dibner, founded Energy Conversion Laboratory in a storefront in Detroit, dedicating the laboratory to the solution of important societal problems using science and technology. Focusing on the critical areas of energy and information, their new company, reconstituted in 1964 as Energy Conversion Devices (ECD), went on to become a forefront invention and development laboratory whose products have built new industries, many of them aimed at making fossil fuel obsolete. ECD continues (through joint ventures and license partners) to be a leading solar energy and battery production firm. Roughly a year after Iris Ovshinsky's death in August 2006, Ovshinsky left ECD and established a new company, Ovshinsky Innovation LLC, devoted to developing the scientific basis for highly innovative and revolutionary energy and information technologies. In October 2007 he married Rosa Young, a physicist who had worked at ECD on numerous energy technologies including a hydrogen-powered hybrid car and on Ovshinsky’s vision of a hydrogen-based economy.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elwood_Haynes">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Elwood P. Haynes (October 14, 1857 – April 12, 1925) was an American inventor, metallurgist, automotive pioneer, entrepreneur and industrialist. He invented the metal alloys stellite and martensitic stainless steel and designed one of the earliest automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for mass production and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably. He made many advances in the automotive industry. Early in his career, while serving as a superintendent at gas and oil companies during Indiana's gas boom, Haynes invented several devices important to the advance of the natural gas industry. When working for the Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, he oversaw the construction of the first long-distance natural gas pipeline in the United States, connecting Chicago with the Trenton Gas Field 150 miles (240 km) away. He began to formulate plans for a motorized vehicle in the early 1890s; he successfully road tested his first car, the Pioneer, on July 4, 1894—eight years after the first automobile was patented in Germany. He formed a partnership with Elmer and Edgar Apperson in 1896 to start Haynes-Apperson for the commercial production of automobiles, and he renamed it Haynes Automobile Company in 1905, following the loss of his partners. Working in his auto company's laboratory to develop new corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted in the formation of strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion and could withstand very high temperatures. He formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for twelve years. Because of labor problems, he sold the stellite company and patent to Union Carbide in 1920, and after passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated. He lost a quarter of his fortune in 1925 when he was held personally responsible for a large portion of the company's debts. An outspoken advocate of prohibition, he made substantial donations to the Prohibition Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in Indiana for the U.S. Senate in 1916 as a prohibition candidate and remained active in the party until prohibition became law. Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms as president of the YMCA, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was an active member of the Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising from influenza, his Kokomo mansion was converted into the Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public where many of his original inventions and automobiles are on display.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">John S. Kanzius (March 1, 1944 – February 18, 2009) was an American inventor, radio and TV engineer, one-time station owner and ham radio operator (Call Sign K3TUP) from Erie, Pennsylvania. He invented a method that has the potential to treat cancer, inspired by his own such battle. He also demonstrated a device that generated flammable hydrogen-containing gas from salt-water-solution by the use of radiowaves. In the media this was dubbed "burning salt water". Both effects involve the use of his radio frequency transmitter. Kanzius, an autodidact, stated that he was motivated to research the subject of cancer treatment by his own experiences undergoing chemotherapy for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</dbo:abstract>

The patent (#25,076) was granted on August 9, 1859 for an invention he called "Revolving Stairs". The escalator had steps mounted on a continuous belt or chain. He also patened machines for improvement in polishing leather during the time when Lynn's shoemaking industry was one of the largest in the world. Another one of his pattens was for a polygraph, an early copying machine that operated by using pens connected by wires. Another patent he held was for an improved grater. A writer and a poet, Ames performed many disquisitions while at Harvard and had a Class Ode published in 1848. His book of poetry Pirate’s Glen and Dungeon Rock was published in 1853. These poems were based the local pirate legend of Dungeon Rock. His brother Joseph was a famous American portrait artist.</dbo:abstract>

He is best remembered for his invention of an early instant coffee process and for the company he founded to mass-produce it, the G. Washington Coffee Company. An emigrant from his native Belgium, he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and he lived in a mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children. Washington's company was sold to American Home Products in 1943, shortly before his death. Though the coffee brand was discontinued by 1961, Washington's name is still used today in the product G. Washington's Seasoning &amp;amp; Broth.</dbo:abstract>

He was the youngest of seven children born to Henry and Elizabeth Herdic on December 14, 1824 in Fort Plain, New York. Herdic's father died in 1826 and Elizabeth Herdic remarried shortly thereafter. She was widowed again prior to 1837 when she moved her family to Pipe Creek, New York near Ithaca. Herdic attended school for just a few years while he worked on his mother's 50-acre (200,000 m) farm. Herdic left his mother's farm in 1846 and arrived in Lycoming County later that same year, where he settled in Cogan House Township. Herdic would go on to become one of the wealthiest men in Pennsylvania and was a major figure in the development of the lumber industry throughout North Central Pennsylvania. Herdic donated large amounts of land and money to various churches in Williamsport. Peter Herdic was the inventor of the Herdic cab (a precursor to the taxi), which was a two wheeled horse drawn carriage with side seats and a rear entrance. Peter Herdic died on February 2, 1888 as the result of a concussion sustained when he slipped and fell on ice while inspecting his waterworks in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.</dbo:abstract>

Semon put his name into the history books for inventing vinyl, the world's second most used plastic. He found the formula for vinyl by mixing a few synthetic polymers, and the result was a substance that was elastic, but wasn't adhesive. Semon worked on methods of improving rubber, and eventually developed a synthetic substitute. On December 11, 1935, he created Koreosol from salt, coke and limestone, a polymer that could be made in any consistency. . Semon made more than 5,000 other synthetic rubber compounds, achieving success with Ameripol (AMERican POLymer) in 1940 for the B.F. Goodrich company. . In all, Semon held 116 patents, and was inducted into the Invention Hall of Fame in 1995 at age 97. Semon is sometimes credited with inventing bubble gum, but this is inaccurate. He did invent an indigestible synthetic rubber substance that could be used as a bubble gum (and produced exceptionally large bubbles), but the product remained a curiosity and was never sold. Semon graduated from the University of Washington earning a BS in chemistry and a PhD in chemical engineering.</dbo:abstract>

He also played an important role in the development of the ARPANET at UCLA. His most well-known and significant work is his early work on queueing theory, which has applications in many fields, among them as a key mathematical background to packet switching, the basic technology behind the Internet. His initial contribution to this field was his doctoral thesis in 1962, published in book form in 1964; he later published several of the standard works on the subject. He has described this work as: "Basically, what I did for my PhD research in 1961&amp;ndash;1962 was to establish a mathematical theory of packet networks.... " His theoretical work on hierarchical routing, done in the late 1970s with his then-student Farouk Kamoun, is now critical to the operation of today's worldwide Internet.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Earl William "Madman" Muntz (January 3, 1914 – June 21, 1987) was an American businessman and engineer who sold and promoted cars and consumer electronics in the United States from the 1930s until his death in 1987. He was a pioneer in television commercials with his oddball "Madman" persona – an alter ego who generated publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims. Muntz also pioneered car stereos by creating the Muntz Stereo-Pak, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to the 8-track cartridge developed by Lear Industries. He invented the practice that came to be known as Muntzing, which involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices. Muntz produced and marketed the first black-and-white television receivers to sell for less than $100, and created one of the earliest functional widescreen projection TVs. He was credited with coining the abbreviation "TV" for television, although the term had earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as WCBS-TV. A high school dropout, Muntz made fortunes by selling automobiles, TV receivers, and car stereos and tapes. A 1968 Los Angeles Times article noted that in one year he sold $72 million worth of cars, that five years later he sold $55 million worth of TV receivers, and that in 1967 he sold $30 million worth of car stereos and tapes. After his success as a used car salesman and with Kaiser-Frazer dealerships in Los Angeles and New York City, Muntz founded the Muntz Car Company, which made the "Muntz Jet", a sports car with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953, although fewer than 400 were produced. Muntz married seven times. His wives included actress Joan Barton and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens Finishing Schools. Phyllis Diller was among his many girlfriends. He was friends with celebrities such as singer Rudy Vallee, comedian Jerry Colonna, actor Bert Lahr, television presenter Dick Clark, and actor Gene Autry.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carl_Akeley">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Carl Ethan Akeley (19 May 1864 - 18 November 1926) was a taxidermist, sculptor, biologist, conservationist, inventor, and nature photographer, noted for his contributions to American museums, most notably to the American Museum of Natural History. He is considered the father of modern taxidermy. He was born in Clarendon, New York, and grew up on a farm, attending school for only three years. He learned taxidermy from David Bruce in Brockport, New York, and then entered an apprenticeship in taxidermy at Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York. In 1886 Akeley moved on to the Milwaukee Public Museum (MPM) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he created the world's first complete museum habitat diorama in 1890. While working at the MPM and at Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, he developed his innovative techniques of taxidermy, perfecting a "cement gun" for improving exhibits. He later applied this method to patch old buildings with concrete, and is today known as the inventor of shotcrete. Akeley specialized in African mammals, particularly the gorilla and the elephant. As a taxidermist, he improved on techniques of fitting the skin over a carefully prepared and sculpted form of the animal's body, producing very lifelike specimens, with consideration of musculature, wrinkles, and veins. He also displayed the specimens in groups in a natural setting. Many animals that he preserved he had personally collected. In 1909 Akeley accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on an expedition to Africa and began working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where his efforts can still be seen in the Akeley African Hall. Akeley joined The Explorers Club in 1912, having been sponsored by three of the Club's seven Charter Members: Frank Chapman, Henry Collins Walsh, and Marshall Saville. For qualifying, Akeley wrote only, "Explorations in Somaliland and British East Africa. " He became the Club's sixth president in 1917–1918. In 1921, eager to learn about gorillas to determine if killing them for museum dioramas was justified, Akeley led an expedition to Mt. Mikeno in the Virungas at the edge of the then Belgian Congo. At that time, gorillas were quite exotic, with very few even in zoos, and collecting such animals for educational museum exhibitions was not uncommon. In the process of “collecting” several mountain gorillas, Akeley’s attitude was fundamentally changed and for the remainder of his life he worked for the establishment of a gorilla preserve in the Virungas. In 1925, greatly influenced by Akeley, King Albert I of Belgium established the Albert National Park,. It was Africa's first national park. Opposed to hunting them for sport or trophies, he remained an advocate of collection for scientific and educational purposes. One of the members of his 1921 expedition was six-year-old Alice Hastings Bradley, who later wrote science fiction under the name James Tiptree, Jr.. He improved the motion picture camera for working in nature. Akeley also wrote several books, including stories for children and an autobiography, In Brightest Africa (1923). He was awarded more than thirty patents for his inventions. Akeley died of a fever in the Congo during his fifth expedition to Africa. He is buried in Africa, just miles from where he encountered his first gorilla, the “Old Man of Mikeno. ” His wife, Mary Jobe Akeley, married him two years before he died. He had previously been married to Delia J. Akeley (1875–1970) for nearly twenty years. Delia Akeley accompanied him on two of his biggest and most productive safaris to Africa in 1905 and again in 1909. Delia later returned to Africa twice under the auspices of the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences. She organized and led both trips and lived for several months in the Ituri Forest with Pygmies. The World Taxidermy &amp;amp; Fish Carving Championships awards gold medallions that bear Carl Akeley’s likeness—based on a photograph he had taken at Stein Photography in Milwaukee—to its “Best in World” winners. There is also a Carl Akeley Award for the most artistic mount at the World Show. The medallions were sculpted by Floyd Easterman of the Milwaukee Public Museum. The Akeley Hall of African Mammals of the American Museum of Natural History is named for him.</dbo:abstract>

Gore received both a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering in 1933 and a masters of science in chemistry in 1935 from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Gore and his wife Genevieve founded W. L. Gore and Associates in the basement of their Newark, Delaware home in 1958. Gore co-developed with his son, Robert W. Gore, the process by which PTFE resin could be stretched wide enough to laminate it to fabric. These fabrics were made into the first laminate product, a tent made by the Seattle outdoor recreational firm of Early Winters, Ltd. in 1976. Bill Gore died of a heart attack in 1986 while on a backpacking trip in Wyoming's Wind River Range. His firm is still privately owned and now does over two billion dollars in sales each year. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A hall was named after Gore at the University of Delaware, and Westminster College, Salt Lake City named its business school in his honor.

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Dr. Ann A. Kiessling (born March 29, 1942) is an American reproductive biologist and is currently one of the leaders in human parthenogenic stem cell research at The Bedford Stem Cell Research Foundation. She also has an appointment in the Department of Surgery at Harvard Medical School Dr. Kiessling is noted for her discovery of reverse transcriptase activity in normal human cells (Kiessling &amp;amp; Goulian). This report pioneered the importance of naturally occurring retrovirus sequences in human genes, now thought to be important to the genetic plasticity involved in human evolution and biology. Prior to this discovery, it had been assumed that reverse transcriptase was an enzyme found only in retroviruses. To understand the normal biologic role of reverse transcriptase, Dr. Kiessling began to study eggs and early cleaving embryos. Her dual interests in virology and reproductive biology led to research in semen transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and the creation of the first laboratory for Human In Vitro Fertilization in Oregon in the early 1980s. Harvard Medical School recruited Dr. Kiessling in 1985, where she continues her research today. The need to conduct biomedical research in areas not funded by the federal government led to the incorporation of the Bedford Stem Cell Research Foundation. The Foundation's controversial Special Program of Assisted Reproduction (SPAR) has helped more than 70 couples affected by HIV disease have healthy babies. Because of this success, more than two-dozen fertility centers throughout the country have implemented the SPAR program, allowing couples to seek care close to home. The techniques developed for the Special Program of Assisted Reproduction have now been extended to other diseases of the male genitourinary tract, such as prostatitis and bladder infections. Expertise in human egg biology led Dr. Kiessling to develop the country's first human egg donor program for stem cell research in 2000. It remains a research focus today. Dr. Kiessling has published more than 100 scientific papers and given more than 60 lectures to audiences around the world. Her writings can be found in publications such as Nature, Lancet and in proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Among her noted publications is the first comprehensive look at the influence of accurate science terminology on laws titled, "What is an Embryo," published by the Connecticut Law Review along with rejoinders by Dr. Harold Shapiro, Prof John A. Robertson, Prof. Lars Noah, and Father Kevin P. Quinn. The law review specifically addresses the controversy of all of the entities that are currently called embryos with regards to embryonic stem cell research legislation around the wold. Dr. Kiessling has been the focus of articles in The Boston Globe, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Associated Press and Newsweek. In 2003, Dr. Kiessling wrote Human Embryonic Stem Cells: An Introduction to the Science and Therapeutic Potential, the first textbook on the controversial topic. Dr. Kiessling is a current member of the California and Connecticut Stem Cell Research Advisory Boards, and a member of the Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committees (ESCROS) for Harvard University, Joslin Diabetes Center and Children's Hospital.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Paul Wilbur Klipsch (March 9, 1904 – May 5, 2002) was an American engineer and high fidelity audio pioneer, known for developing the high-efficiency folded horn loudspeaker, who revolutionized the way the world listens to recorded music. Unsatisfied with the sound quality of phonographs and early speaker systems, Klipsch used scientific principles to develop a corner horn speaker that sounded more lifelike than its predecessors. The Klipschorn, which today is still manufactured and sold worldwide, proved that it was possible to reproduce the sound of a live orchestra inside a home. The resulting acoustics career of Klipsch spanned from 1946, when he founded one of the first U.S. loudspeaker companies, to 2000 when the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society published one of his papers. He died on May 5, 2002 at the age of 98. Fred Klipsch, current Klipsch owner and chairman and cousin to founder Paul Wilbur Klipsch, said, “Paul was a verifiable genius who could have chosen any number of vocations, but the world sounds a lot better because he chose audio. ”</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Marcel Joseph Vogel (1917 - 1991) was a research scientist working at the IBM San Jose Advanced Systems Development Division "Los Gatos Lab" (actually located in San Jose) for some 27 years. He is sometimes referred to as Dr. Vogel, however he held an honorary doctoral degree, not an earned Ph.D. degree. It is claimed that Vogel started his research into luminescence while he was still in his teens. This research eventually led him to publish his thesis Luminescence in Liquids and Solids and Their Practical Application in collaboration with Chicago University's Dr. Peter Pringsheim in 1943. Two years after the publication, Vogel incorporated his own company, called Vogel Luminescence, in San Francisco. For the next decade the firm developed a variety of new products: fluorescent crayons, tags for insecticides, a black light inspection kit to determine the secret trackways of rodents in cellars from their urine, and the psychedelic colors popular in "new age" posters. In 1957, Vogel Luminescence was sold to Ultra Violet Products and Vogel joined IBM as a full-time research scientist. He received numerous patents for his inventions. Among these was the magnetic coating for the 24” hard disk drive systems still in use. His areas of expertise, besides luminescence, were phosphor technology, magnetics and liquid crystal systems. He also designed the vogel crystal which allegedly focuses "universal life force" by concentrating it to a higher level. Vogel crystals are cut to the exact angle of 51 degrees 51 minutes and 51 seconds or the exact angle of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The crystal is designed after the geometry of the Tree of Life symbol. Its design is said to have come to him in a dream. Vogel examined a metal sample which was allegedly given to Billy Meier by "extraterrestrials" and marvelled at its unusual properties (Vogel stated it contained the element thulium); however, it is worthwhile to note that Vogel was a chemist rather than a metallurgist. Dr. Vogel was featured in the first episode of In Search Of hosted by Leonard Nimoy called "Other Voices". He gave his theories regarding the possibility of communication between plants.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Mark P. McCahill (born February 7, 1956) is an American programmer who has been involved in developing and popularizing a number of Internet technologies since the late 1980s. Mark McCahill received a BA in Chemistry at the University of Minnesota in 1979, spent one year doing analytical environmental chemistry, and then joined the University of Minnesota Computer Center's microcomputer support group as an Apple II and CDC Cyber programmer. In 1989, McCahill lead the team at the University of Minnesota that developed one of the first popular Internet e-mail clients, POPmail, for the Macintosh (and later the PC). The usage of graphical user interface clients for Internet standards-based protocols proved to be one of the dominant themes in the popularization of the Internet. At about the same time as POPmail was being developed, Steve Dorner at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed Eudora, and the user interface conventions found in these early efforts continue to be present in modern-day e-mail clients. In 1991, McCahill led the original Gopher development team (Farhad Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Dan Torrey, Bob Alberti), which invented a simple way to navigate distributed information resources on the Internet. Gopher's menu-based hypermedia combined with full-text search engines paved the way for the popularization of the World Wide Web and was the de facto standard for Internet information systems in the early to mid 1990s. Working with other pioneers such as Tim Berners-Lee, Marc Andreessen, Alan Emtage and Peter J. Deutsch and Jon Postel, McCahill was involved in creating and codifing the standard for Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). In 1994-95 McCahill's team developed GopherVR, a 3D user interface for the Gopher protocol to explore how spatial metaphors could be used to organize information and create social spaces. While there was significant interest in the mid-1990s in 3D Internet-enabled information/social spaces, the limitied capabilities of mainstream hardware resulted in little uptake of these technologies. Mark McCahill was involved in the Croquet project along with David P. Reed, Andreas Raab, David A Smith, Julian Lombardi, and Alan Kay. In April 2007, McCahill left the University of Minnesota to join the Office of Information Technology at Duke University as an architect of 3-D learning and collaborative systems. In February 2010, Mark McCahill was revealed by Peter Ludlow (Urizenus Sklar) to be the Internet persona Pixeleen Mistral, the editor of The Alphaville Herald, a newspaper covering virtual worlds founded by Ludlow.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Walter Hunt (1796–1859) was an American mechanic. He lived and worked in New York state. Through the course of his work he became renowned for being a prolific inventor, notably of the sewing machine (1833), safety pin (1849), a forerunner of the Winchester repeating rifle, a successful flax spinner, knife sharpener, streetcar bell, hard-coal-burning stove, artificial stone, street sweeping machinery, the velocipede, and the ice plough. Hunt did not realize the significance of a good load of these when he invented them; today, many are widely-used products. He thought little of the safety pin, selling the patent for a paltry sum of $400 (roughly $10,000 in 2008 dollars) to the company W R Grace and Company, to pay a man to whom he owed $15. He failed to patent his sewing machine at all, because he feared that it would create unemployment among seamstresses. (This led to an 1854 court case when the machine was re-invented by Elias Howe; Hunt's machine shown to have design flaws limiting its practical use). Like Howe, Hunt is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Some of his important inventions are shown here with drawings from the patent.

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Leopold Damrosch Mannes (December 26, 1899 – August 11, 1964) was a Jewish-American musician, born in New York City, who, together with Leopold Godowsky, Jr. , created the first practical color transparency film, Kodachrome. Leopold Mannes was son of David Mannes and Clara Damrosch. Mannes and Godowsky's experimentation with color photography began in 1917, after seeing the film Our Navy in Prizma Color, which was advertised as a color film. Because of the low quality the boys felt cheated and decided to do something about it. They built a movie camera and projector, each with three lenses covered by red, blue, and yellow filters. They took multiple black-and-white exposures and projected them back through the filters. They patented this system while still in high school, but it was not a commercially viable process. Mannes went on to study piano at Harvard and earned a Pulitzer Music Scholarship and a Guggenheim fellowship (1926) to study music composition in Italy. He later continued to play professional piano while studying physics at Harvard. Godowsky studied violin at UCLA and became a violinist with the Los Angeles and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Although a continent apart, they continued to collaborate on ideas for improving color photography. By 1922, Godowsky had given up his orchestra jobs in California and moved back to New York City where he and Mannes worked as musicians. They experimented with color photography during their spare time. While on his way to perform in Europe in late 1922, Mannes made the chance acquaintance of a senior partner in the investment firm of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. and described their progress with color photography. Some months later the firm sent one of their junior associates, Lewis L. Strauss to the Mannes apartment to view the color process. The final results were impressive enough for Kuhn Loeb to invest in the process. With financial backing, Mannes and Godowsky built a dedicated laboratory and in 1924 took out additional patents on their work. In 1930 Eastman Kodak was so impressed with their results that they contracted them to move to Rochester and take advantage of Kodak's research facilities. By 1933, Mannes and Godowsky and the Kodak research staff had developed a marketable three-color emulsion process for color home movies. Kodachrome film consisted of three layers of standard black and white film silver halides suspended in filter material, making each layer sensitive to a different color (red, green or blue). Color dyes replaced the developed silver salts after re-exposure to light during processing. The completed chromogenic film consisted solely of synthesized dyes suspended in gelatin. Kodachrome 16mm movie film was released for sale in 1935, and in 1936 Kodachrome 35mm still and 8mm movie film were released. Mannes returned to music after inventing Kodachrome, performing as a pianist and composing several musical scores. He served as president of the Mannes College of Music (founded by his parents in New York) and served as a judge in music competitions, including the first Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Leopold Godowsky, Jr. married George Gershwin's younger sister, the singer Frances Gershwin, who went on to become a painter and sculptor. He continued the musical tradition of his father, Leopold Godowsky (who was a well known pianist in his time), playing violin with the Los Angeles and San Francisco Symphony Orchestras, as well as performing jointly with his father. Mannes and Godowsky were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005.</dbo:abstract>

In his youth, he was known as one of the most skilled card players in the United States. Following his retirement from gambling in 1842, he became an active crusader against illegal gambling and was responsible for enacting anti-gambling laws in several states. As an agent for the New York Association for the Suppression of Gambling, he conducted an exhaustive report detailing illegal gambling operations active in the city in 1850-51. He later toured the country as a lecturer and eventually published his memoirs entitled Twelve Days in the Tombs (1851), The Gambler's Life (1857) and The Reformed Gambler (1858).</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 &amp;ndash; October 18, 1931) was an American inventor, scientist and businessman who developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park" by a newspaper reporter, he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large teamwork to the process of invention, and therefore is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. Edison is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history, holding 1,093 U.S. patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. He is credited with numerous inventions that contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison originated the concept and implementation of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Manhattan Island, New York.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Thaddeus Sobieski Coulincourt Lowe (August 20, 1832 - January 16, 1913), also known as Professor T. S. C. Lowe, was an American Civil War aeronaut, scientist and inventor, mostly self-educated in the fields of chemistry, meteorology, and aeronautics. By the late 1850s he was well known for his advanced theories in the meteorological sciences as well as his balloon building. Among his aspirations were plans for a transatlantic flight. Lowe's scientific endeavors were cut short by the onset of the American Civil War. He recognized his patriotic duty in offering his services as an aeronaut for the purposes of performing aerial reconnaissance on the Confederate troops on behalf of the Union Army. In July 1861 Lowe was appointed Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps by President Abraham Lincoln. Though his work was generally successful, it was not fully appreciated by all members of the military, and disputes over his operations and pay scale forced him to resign in 1863. Lowe returned to the private sector and continued his scientific exploration of hydrogen gas manufacturing. He invented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be produced from steam and charcoal. His inventions and patents on this process and ice making machines made him a millionaire. In 1887 he moved to Los Angeles, California, and eventually built a 24,000 sq. ft. (2,230 m) home in Pasadena. He opened several ice making plants and founded Citizen's Bank of Los Angeles. Lowe was introduced to David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer, who had drawn up plans for a scenic mountain railroad. In 1891 they incorporated the Pasadena &amp;amp; Mount Wilson Railroad Co. and began the construction of what would become the Mount Lowe Railway into the hills above Altadena. The railway opened on July 4, 1893 and was met with quick interest and success. Lowe continued construction toward Oak Mountain, renamed Mount Lowe, at an exhaustive rate, both physically and financially. By 1899 Lowe had gone into receivership and eventually lost the railway to Jared S. Torrance. Lowe's fortunes had been all but lost, and he lived out his remaining days at his daughter's home in Pasadena where he died at age 81.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Simeon North (July 13, 1765–August 25, 1852) was a Middletown, Connecticut gun manufacturer, who developed one of America's first milling machines (possibly the very first) in 1818 and played an important role in the development of interchangeable parts manufacturing. North was born in Berlin, Connecticut to a prosperous family, able to provide all six sons with farms of their own. North was given a farm in Berlin, a gift that enabled him to marry Lucy Savage when he was only twenty-one. The couple would have five sons and three daughters. In 1795 the Norths purchased a sawmill located on the brook that ran beside their land. He hired a man to help run it, enlarged the building to house a forge and trip-hammer, and began manufacturing scythes from imported steel. Four years later, he obtained a contract to make pistols and began to add a factory to the mill building. North's brother-in-law, Elisha Cheney was skilled clockmaker, a trade he had learned from his father Benjamin Cheney and uncle Timothy Cheney, two of the finest clockmakers in Connecticut. In 1810 Elisha Cheney moved his clock-making shop to the next waterpower site upstream from North. Although Cheney was trained as a maker of fine clocks in brass and other methods, Eli Terry, a clockmaker who had trained as a clockmaker with either Timothy or Benjamin Cheney, had just invented a method of mass-producing the parts for wooden shelf, or pillar-and-scroll clocks that enabled them to be mass-produced using interchangeable parts. Cheney used his new plant to mass-produce parts that manufacturers were turning out in emulation of Eli Terry's innovation. Cheney is known to have also produced screws and small metal parts in his mill for the pistols his Simeon North was manufacturing just downstream. North is now generally credited with the invention of the milling machine—the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and the machine that, by replacing filing, made interchangeable parts practical. By 1813, North had signed a government contract to produce 20,000 pistols that specified that parts of the lock had to be completely interchangeable between any of the 20,000 locks—the first such contract of which any such evidence exists. It is during this period that North is believed to have invented a milling machine-the first entirely new type of machine invented in America and the machine that was able to shape metal mechanically and that, by replacing filing, made interchangeable parts practical. Historian Diana Muir believes that he accomplished this around 1816. According to Muir's book Reflections in Bullough's Pond, North "was the first arms maker to implement a number of machine production techniques, yet he cautiously halted his pursuit of mass-produced, interchangeable parts" whenever it became apparent that it was uneconomic. For some time, interchangeable parts manufacturing in metal would continue to be a combination of machine-made parts and human skill in filling machine-parts parts to precise size for such high-end uses as military weapons where interchangeable parts were worth paying for at high prices. (They were worth it because an army on campaign could cannibalize damaged weapons for parts. ) As North's business grew, he moved it from Berlin to nearby Middletown. At about that time, North was sent to Captain John H. Hall, superintendent at Harpers Ferry (Va. ) Armory, to introduce his methods of achieving interchangeability. In 1828, North received a contract to produce 5,000 Hall rifles with parts interchangeable with those produced at Harpers Ferry. North had a 53-year contractual relationship with the War Dept. The report of Charles H. Fitch prepared for the 1880 Census credits North with a key role in developing manufacture with interchangeable parts. American Precision. Com.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Carleen Maley Hutchins (May 24, 1911 &amp;ndash; August 7, 2009) was an American former high school science teacher, violinmaker and researcher, best-known for her creation, in the 1950s/60s, of a family of eight proportionally-sized violins now known as the violin octet and for a considerable body of research into the acoustics of violins. She was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. Hutchins’s greatest innovation, still used by many violinmakers, was a technique known as free-plate tuning. When not attached to a violin, the top and back are called free plates. Her technique gives makers a precise way to refine these plates before a violin is assembled. From 2002 to 2003, Hutchins’s octet was the subject of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Titled “The New Violin Family: Augmenting the String Section. ” Hutchins was the founder of the New Violin Family Association, creator-in-chief of the Violin Octet, author of more than 100 technical publications, editor of two volumes of collected papers in violin acoustics, four grants from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund for Music, recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, an Honorary Fellowship from the Acoustical Society of America, and four honorary doctorates. In 1963, Hutchins co-founded the Catgut Acoustical Society, which develops scientific insights into the construction of new and conventional instruments of the violin family. The Hutchins Consort, named after Hutchins, is a California ensemble featuring all eight instruments. In 1974, Hutchins and Daniel W. Haines, using materials supplied by the Hercules Materials Company, Inc. (Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory) of Cumberland, Maryland, developed a graphite-epoxy composite top that was determined to be a successful alternative to the traditional use of spruce for the violin belly.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Ambrose Swasey (December 19, 1846–June 15, 1937) was an American mechanical engineer, inventor, entrepreneur, manager, astronomer, and philanthropist. With Worcester R. Warner he co-founded the Warner &amp;amp; Swasey Company. Swasey was born near Exeter, New Hampshire. He apprenticed as a machinist at the Exeter Machine Works and was afterwards employed at Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney. As his career progressed he became a foreman in the gear-cutting section. He developed a new technique for making gear-tooth cutters. In 1880 he and Warner formed their eponymous firm, which quickly moved to Cleveland, Ohio. Swasey would perform the engineering and machine development at this company. The close friends Warner and Swasey built their homes next to each other on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, a street that was known as "Millionaire's Row". In addition to army ordinance contracts, the firm of Warner &amp;amp; Swasey became notable for their work on astronomical observatories and equipment. They realized that obtaining contracts to build large astronomical observatories would provide publicity for their company. In 1885 Swasey completed work at McCormick Observatory on the 45-foot dome, which was the largest in the world, and had a unique, 3 shutter design. In 1887 Swasey built the mount for the 36-inch refracting telescope at Lick Observatory. In 1898 he manufactured a dividing engine for the U.S. Naval Observatory that was used to make the meridian circles. Both the building and dome of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory were made by Warner and Swasey Co. Other observatory telescopes and components were built by the company at the Kenwood Observatory, Yerkes Observatory, Argentia National Observatory, and the Case Institute Observatory. From 1904 until 1905 he was the president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Both Warner and Swasey were amateur astronomers. In 1920 they made a joint donation to the Case Western Reserve University to fund the construction of an observatory. This was named the Warner and Swasey Observatory in their honor, and the observatory was used for research by the Case astronomy department. The observatory maintained by the department today is still known by this name today. Other donations made by Swasey include the Swasey Chapel in Cleveland (1924), a bandstand in Exeter by architect Henry Bacon, (1916), and the endowment of a chair for a professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Sciences. The chimes in the chapel were included as a memorial to his wife, Lavinia Marston Swasey. He died in Exeter. The Warner &amp;amp; Swasey Company he cofounded would continue until 1980, when it was acquired by Bendix Corporation.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Calvin Souther Fuller (May 25, 1902 &amp;ndash; October 28, 1994) was a physical chemist at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Laboratories where he worked for 37 years from 1930-1967 when he went into mandatory retirement at the age of 65. He was credited as the co-inventor of the solar cell also known as the solar battery. Calvin S. Fuller worked with silicon and realized its conductive qualities. In particular, he discovered how to purify silicon, devising a special furnace and a melting process to get rid of the impurities in Silicon. Working with Bell Telephone scientists Daryl Chapin and Gerald Pearson, Fuller diffused boron into silicon to capture the sun's power. In doing so, they created the first practical means of collecting energy from the sun and turning it into a current of electricity. The invention of the solar battery resulted in a 600% improvement in the ability to harness the sun's power into electricity. First, Fuller ensured that silicon was uncorrupted and pure. And then Fuller accomplished the diffusion of boron into silicon. The inventors used several small strips of silicon to capture free electrons and render them into sunlight. Bell Laboratories, who had funded the research, announced the prototype manufacture of a new solar battery. In spite of the patents, Fuller never got rich from this invention. Most intellectual property in those days belonged to the research lab and the silicon solar cell was no different. Fuller invented for purist reasons and never sought large monetary gains from his invention, instead preferring the love of conducting science for science's sake. Here is a story told by Calvin S. Fuller's oldest son Robert W. Fuller as part of the speech preparation for Calvin S. Fuller's May 2008 induction to the National Inventor's Hall of Fame: "In 1954 I was home from vacation from college to visit my parents. That night my father, Calvin Souther Fuller, came home with something that looked like a quarter with wires sticking out of it. This was a device that connected to a small electric windmill that stood on the table. He shined a bright flashlight on the quarter-like object, which was actually silicon solar cell, and the blades of the windmill started turning. It was so exciting to see the flashlight power the tiny windmill. While this device looked like a quarter to anyone else, it was actually the world’s first silicon solar battery - a device that later become known as the silicon solar cell. " The first public service trial of the Bell Solar Battery began with a telephone carrier system in 1955. By 1958, the US Department of Defense realized an extremely valuable application of this device as it deployed self-sufficient, power to vehicles and satellites in space. Calvin S. Fuller attended the University of Chicago where he earned his PhD in 1929. His mentor was Professor Hawkins, a chemistry professor. During World War II, Calvin S. Fuller traveled all over the U.S. by train as the Head of synethic rubber for the United States Government, because the sources of real rubber, from trees, were threatened. Fuller's legacy remains today. Fuller was granted 33 patents. Some, including renowned solar historian John Perlin, have called his inventions a pivotal step in the founding of semiconductors and the evolution of the personal computer. Before Fuller figured out how to purify Silicon, a rare element called germanium was seen as the key material for creating semiconductors. Fuller's purification and use of one of the world's most ubiquitous substances sand (silicon), provided the key material for the creation of silicon-based technologies. Calvin S. Fuller was married to Willmine Fuller. They had three children, Robert W. Fuller, Stephen Fuller, and John Fuller and eight grandchildren including Ben Fuller, Vice President of Link TV. Fuller moved to Vero Beach, Florida after he retired from Bell Labs. When he wasn't in Vero Beach, Florida, he spent his time traveling around the United States in a Silver Stream Camper with his wife. Fuller died in Vero Beach, Florida. He was 92. Calvin Fuller died in 1994, having lived to see his invention significantly improve the quality of life on our planet. Today, solar cells and panels can be found all over the world.</dbo:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grady_A._Dugas">
    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Grady A. Dugas, M.D. (October 24, 1923 - March 25, 2007), was a Louisiana physician who invented the "Safer Automatic Wheelchair Wheel Locks", a patented device designed for those who sometimes forget to lock their wheelchairs. For four decades Dugas was engaged in a family medical practice in tiny Marion in Union Parish, a part of the Monroe Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, in northeast Louisiana. As the medical director of the Marion Nursing Home for some three decades, he became aware of the problem of wheelchair-related falls among semi-ambulatory patients who did not or could not remember to use manual brakes on their wheelchairs. Some patients in wheelchairs, particularly the elderly, have a tendency to fall and injure themselves when trying to stand because they fail to engage the manual locks. Dugas hence attempted to find a way to save these patients from potentially debilitating injuries. He began his experimentation with locking systems and procured his first patent (#5,203,433) on April 20, 1993. The wheelchair locks/brakes are made of stainless steel, and worked well but were heavy and had a tendency to require maintenance. In 1996, Dugas joined Bill Hoge of United Plastic Molders in Jackson, Mississippi, for further experimentation to improve the wheelchair locks/brakes. A second patent (# 5,984,334) was issued on November 29, 1999). Dugas and Hoge formed the corporation SAFER Automatic Wheelchair Wheel Locks of Mississippi, Inc. The locks sell for approximately $120. Dugas was born in Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish in southwestern Louisiana to Sona Dugas (1894-1964) and the former Mildred Meyers (1900-1987). In 1941, Dugas graduated from Sulphur High School as president of the senior class. He attended McNeese State University in Lake Charles, the seat of Calcasieu Parish. In 1942, he left McNeese and joined the U.S. Army Air Corps He served in the European theater with the medical air evacuation unit stationed in England and France for the remainder of World War II. After World War II, he returned to college. In 1949, he graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and thereafter in 1953 from the LSU Medical School in New Orleans. After a year of internship at Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, he moved with his wife, the former Annie Jo Sehon, and infant son to Marion, where, in 1954, he joined Dr. Virgil Gully in the Marion Hospital-Clinic. After Gully left for health reasons, Dugas maintained the hospital until 1965, and thereafter the clinic and private practice until 1991. Discover magazine reported in 1993 how Dugas had used maggots to cure the bedsores of an 80-year-old male patient. Some of the sores were nearly an inch deep, and infection had set in. Conventional therapies, including antibiotics and surgery, had failed. Dugas told the magazine that he remembered his grandmother, who was diabetic, had undergone successful maggot treatment in the 1930s. He followed suit, and the man's sore healed within a month. Instead of facing amputation, the patient instead went into the hospital for skin grafts. In 1972, Marion named Dr. Dugas "Outstanding Citizen of the Year". On March 30, 1990, Marion declared "Dr. Dugas Day", when special awards were presented. In 2005, Union Parish proclaimed him the "Outstanding Citizen of the Year for Community Service". Dugas died in Monroe. The Dugases had a daughter, Denise (born 1958) of Monroe, who is married to Joel Graham Taylor (born 1954), and four sons, two of whom, David Rene Dugas (born 1954) of Monroe and Christopher L. Dugas (born 1956) of Buffalo, Missouri, are also physicians. The other sons are Stephen Emile Dugas (born 1953) of Kansas City, Missouri, and Kenneth L. Dugas (born 1956) of Plano, Texas. Dugas is interred at Roark Cemetery in Marion.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Lyman Reed Blake (August 24, 1835 – October 3, 1883) was an American inventor who devised a sewing machine for sewing the soles of shoes to the vamp of the shoe. Born in South Abington, Massachusetts, Blake started off in the shoemaker business at a young age, first working for his brother Samuel. Blake later worked in inventor Isaac Singer's company, Singer Corporation, setting up sewing machines in shoe factories. By 1856, he had become a partner in a shoemaking company and spent his time inventing machines to help speed up the process of shoemaking. Two years later, on July 6, 1858, Blake received a patent from the United States government for his sewing machine for helping attach the soles of shoes to the upper of the shoe. The sewing machine helped permit the production of low-cost shoes by eliminating the heavy work of hand sewing. Blake then sold the patent to Gordon McKay a year after for $8,000 in cash and a $62,000 share of future profits. Blake later worked for McKay from 1861 until his retirement in 1874, working on improving the machine. The McKay sole-sewing machine was at the top of the market for twenty-one years in both the United States and Great Britain. Blake died on October 5, 1883 at the age of 48.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Milton Bradley (November 8, 1836 – May 30, 1911), an American game pioneer, was credited by many with launching the board game industry in North America with Milton Bradley Company. A native of Vienna, Maine, in his late teens Bradley chose to pursue the printing trade, including lithography. He set up the first color lithography shop in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, established in Springfield in 1860. Eventually, Bradley moved forward with an idea he had for a board game which he called The Checkered Game of Life, an early version of what would later become The Game of Life. Although it is claimed that he invented the paper cutter, this is untrue. In 2004, he was posthumously inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame along with George Ditomassi of Milton Bradley Co. Through the 20th century, the company he founded dominated the production of American games, with titles like Candyland, Operation, and Battleship. The company is now a subsidiary of Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro.</dbo:abstract>

In addition to being amateur Pacific Coast Billiards Champion several times, a world champion contender in more than one cue sports discipline, and an exhibition player in Europe, he became the co-inventor in 1897 of modern billiard chalk. He was originally (and again in retirement from the billiards circuit) a Californian, but spent much of his professional career in Chicago, Illinois. At his peak, the New York Times labeled Spinks "[one] of the most brilliant players among the veterans of the game", and he still holds the world record for points scored in a row (1,010) using a particular shot type. Aside from his billiards playing career, he founded a lucrative sporting goods manufacturing business, and was both a petroleum company investor and director, and a flower and avocado farm operator and horticulturist, originator of the eponymous Spinks avocado cultivar.</dbo:abstract>

Murray (October 21, 1860 &amp;ndash; July 21, 1929) was an American inventor and businessman who developed electric power plants for New York City as well as many electrical devices which influenced life around the world, including the dimmer switch and screw-in fuse. It has been said that he "invented everything from the power plant up to the light bulb". Murray is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history after Thomas Edison, holding 462 U.S. patents in his name. However, unlike Edison, Murray did not patent the work of others under his name; the employee would have the patent in their name, and assign it to the Murray company. Also, if Murray worked with anyone else on an invention, their name would be listed on the patent.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty (born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 25, 1934) is an American surgeon and inventor of the embolectomy catheter. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. In 1963, Dr. Thomas Fogarty published an article describing "a new method for extraction of arterial emboli and thrombi. " The balloon embolectomy catheter was used on a human patient for the first time six weeks after Fogarty came up with the idea in 1961. Today, using only local anesthesia, the procedure only takes about an hour. Fogarty’s inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed. When asked about the time the impact his invention had on the field, he says, "I had no concept that [non-invasive surgery] would reach the magnitude that it has. " As a result of the invention, Dr. Fogarty, still alive today, went on to win many prizes and patent over sixty inventions.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Joseph Millard Merrow (June 24, 1848 – March 27, 1947) was president of the Merrow Machine Company. Merrow was born in the community of Merrow, town of Mansfield in Connecticut. His parents were J. B. Merrow and Harriet Millard Merrow. He was educated at the Munson Mass Academy and Hartford Public High School. At the age of 15 he was employed as a pharmacist and a postmaster, appointed by Abraham Lincoln. Established in 1838, the family business was the manufacture of knit cotton goods; it was the first of its kind in the country. In 1888 the family's mills were destroyed by fire related to an incident with gunpowder. J. B. Merrow held a patent on gunpowder. The destruction of the mill allowed the company to further develop a small shop that had previously supported the knitting mill, and the Merrow Mills thus became primarily a manufacturer of crochet sewing machines. Joseph Merrow was the driving force behind Merrow developing new technology, growing the new business and transforming it from a regional supplier of crochet sewing machines, to the market leader manufacturing hundreds of models of industrial overlock sewing machines. Under his leadership the company achieved a place of prominence in the industrial machine field with sales world-wide, hundreds of patents and the industries first industrial overlock sewing machine. Merrow was also active in politics. In 1880 he was elected to the House of Representatives of the General Assembly. He was founder and president of the Hartford County Manufacturers association. In addition he founded the Industrial Memorials Inc, a business group that devoted its time to commemorating pioneer manufacturers by funding and locating plaques and statues. He was president from 1839 until 1946. Merrow traveled the world, taking several dozen trips to europe and asia, while studying the industrial conditions of the countries he visited. He was a writer and a poet. The Hartford Courant writing his obituary quotes him as having defined war as the 'history of the human race in a single word, Greed the cause of war and brotherly love the cure for greed and the end of war'. Merrow never married, although his great nephews Owen and Charlie Merrow maintain his legacy as the current managers of the Merrow Sewing Machine Company.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">Steve Moertel (July 16, 1907-September 19, 1995) was born in Cairo, Egypt and grew up on a small corn farm in that city. As a child, he was active in the local 4-H chapter. After graduating in the top 60% of his high school class, Moertel went on to Purdue, where he joined Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity and studied agronomy. Moertel worked as a Vigo County Farm Bureau Extension agent in Terre Haute, Indiana and at Princeton Farms in Princeton, Indiana. He also ran a very successful fertilizer company and became quite wealthy. Since childhood, Moertel had had two single obsessions: unicorns, and creating the perfect popping corn. As an adult, he dedicated all his free time to developing a new strain of popping corn. He eventually settled on a type and went into business with the chemist Jakey Kovac, although he rarely worked on the popping corn. The two named their new hybrid corn Testipops, but were persuaded to change the name by an advertising agency. The result, Steve Moertel Popcorn, struck gold. At first, Moertel sold the kernels from the back of his windowless van. Around 1972, however, Moertel began appearing in television commercials, as himself, hawking his new popcorn. He even appeared on the television show To Tell the Truth where he stumped panelists such as Kitty Carlisle Hart, Peggy Cass, and Joe Garagiola. Initially bought by Hunt-Wesson Foods in 1976, Steve Moertel's popcorn, through a series of business buy-outs, settled under the umbrella of giant ConAgra. Moertel continued to appear in television commercials, sometimes with his grandson, Uni C. Moertel. Immediately recognizable by his black hair, rainbow shirt, and hunched back, Moertel became a beloved pitchman. Consumers were confused as to whether or not he was an actor, so Moertel appeared on television talk shows to clear up the confusion. Steve Moertel died in Coronado, California, on September 19, 1995. He had suffered a heart attack while in his Jacuzzi and drowned. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.</dbo:abstract>

MEDRAD, the company he formed to manufacture and market his invention, has become the leading producer/supplier of power injection devices and disposables in the world. The ICD, which he also helped develop, has revolutionized the treatment of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Now, routinely implanted in tens of thousands of patients who are at high risk for sudden death, ICDs are manufactured by major medical-device giants like Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. These devices have saved tens of thousands of lives and generate over three billion dollars in annual revenues. Heilman, who holds more than 30 patents related to medical imaging, ICDs and cardiac assist devices, has also founded and run several medical device companies, including Medrad, Medrad Intec, Lifecor, and Vascor. He has served on the board of several for-profit and not-for-profit corporations and continues his work with Vascor in developing an implantable heart assist device to treat patients having advanced heart failure.</dbo:abstract>

    <dbo:abstract xml:lang="en">James Oliver (August 28, 1823–March 2, 1908) was an American inventor and industrialist best known for his creation of the South Bend Iron Works, which was reincorporated as the Oliver Farm Equipment Company after his death. After buying a South Bend, Indiana foundry with partner Harvey Little in 1855 he began experimenting with improved farm plow designs. Driven by the sales of his popular Oliver Chilled Plow, for which he registered 45 patents during his lifetime, the company grew to become one of the largest in Indiana and one of the world's largest producers of farm plows during the late 19th Century.</dbo:abstract>
